# Documentation

Documentation is one of the most critical aspects of API design. Users of your
API are unable to dig into the implementation to understand the API better;
often, the API surface definition and its corresponding documentation will be
the only things a user has. Therefore, it is important that documentation be as
clear, complete, and unambiguous as possible.

## Guidance

In APIs defined in protocol buffers, public comments **must** be included over
every component (service, method, message, field, enum, and enum value) using
the protocol buffers comment format. This is important even in cases where the
comment is terse and uninteresting, as numerous tools read these comments and
use them.

Services, in particular, **should** have descriptive comments that explain what
the service is and what users are able to do with it.

**Note:** Many readers will not be native English speakers. Comments **should**
avoid jargon, slang, complex metaphors, pop culture references, or anything
else that will not easily translate. Additionally, many readers will have
different backgrounds and viewpoints; if writing examples involving people,
comments **should** use people who are non-controversial and no longer alive.

### Style

Comments **should** be in gramatically correct American English. However, the
first sentence of each comment **should** omit the subject and be in the
third-person present tense:

```proto
// Creates a book under the given publisher.
rpc CreateBook(CreateBookRequest) returns (Book) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    post: "/v1/{parent=publishers/*}/books"
    body: "book"
  };
}
```

### Descriptions

Descriptions of messages and fields **should** be brief but complete. Sometimes
comments are necessarily perfunctory because there is little to be said;
however, before jumping to that conclusion, consider whether some of the
following questions are relevant:

- What is it?
- How do you use it?
- What does it do if it succeeds? What does it do if it fails?
- Is it idempotent?
- What are the units? (Examples: meters, degrees, pixels)
- What are the side effects?
- What are common errors that may break it?
  - What is the expected input format?
  - What range of values does it accept? (Examples: `[0.0, 1.0)`, `[1, 10]`)
    - Is the range inclusive or exclusive?
  - For strings, what is the minimum and maximum length, and what characters
    are allowed?
- Is it always present? (Example: "Container for voting information. Present
  only when voting information is recorded.")
- Does it have a default setting? (Example: "If `page_size` is omitted, the
  default is 50.")

### Formatting

Any formatting in comments **must** be in [CommonMark][]. Headings and tables
**must not** be used, as these cause problems for several tools, and are
unsuitable for client library reference documentation.

Comments **should** use `code font` for property names and for literals (such
as `true`).

Raw HTML **must not** be used.

### Cross-references

Comments **may** "link" to another component (service, method, message, field,
enum, or enum value) by using the fully-qualified name of the element as a
Markdown reference link. For example: `[Book][google.example.v1.Book]`

### Internal comments

<!-- TODO: This does not work outside of Google.
           We should probably try to get that fixed. -->

Comments **may** be explicitly marked as internal by wrapping internal content
in `(--` and `--)`.

Non-public links, internal implementation notes (such as `TODO` and `FIXME`
directives), and other such material **must** be marked as internal.

## Changelog

- **2019-08-01**: Changed the examples from "shelves" to "publishers", to
  present a better example of resource ownership.
