# API Improvement Proposals (AIPs)

AIP stands for **API Improvement Proposal**, which is a design document
providing high-level, concise documentation for API development. They are to
serve as the source of truth for API-related documentation at Google and the
means by which API teams discuss and come to consensus on API guidance.

Some product areas within Googles have guidance which may supplement (and
occasionally override) the standard rules. These PAs often use the AIP system
too. If so, we list their AIPs here, along with which parts of Google they
apply to. So the complete set of AIPs that apply to you are the General API
Guidance, possibly supplemented by your PA's guidance.
