# Custom methods

[Resource-oriented design][aip-121] uses custom methods to provide a means to
express arbitrary actions that are difficult to model using only the standard
methods. Custom methods are important because they provide a means for an API's
vocabulary to adhere to user intent.

## Guidance

Custom methods **should** only be used for functionality that can not be easily
expressed via standard methods; prefer standard methods if possible, due to
their consistent semantics. (Of course, this only applies if the functionality
in question actually conforms to the normal semantics; it is _not_ a good idea
to contort things to endeavor to make the standard methods "sort of work".)

While custom methods vary widely in how they are designed, many principles
apply consistently:

```proto
// Archives the given book.
rpc ArchiveBook(ArchiveBookRequest) returns (ArchiveBookResponse) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    post: "/v1/{name=publishers/*/books/*}:archive"
    body: "*"
  };
}
```

**Note:** The pattern above shows a custom method that operates on a specific
resource. Custom methods can be associated with resources, collections, or
services. The bullets below apply in all three cases.

- The name of the method **should** be a verb followed by a noun.
  - The name **must not** contain prepositions ("for", "with", etc.).
- The HTTP method for custom methods **should** usually be `POST`, unless the
  custom method maps more strongly to another HTTP verb.
  - Custom methods that serve as an alternative to get or list methods (such as
    `Search`) **should** use `GET`. These methods **must** be idempotent and
    have no side effects.
  - Custom methods **should not** use `PATCH` or `DELETE`.
- The HTTP URI **must** use a `:` character followed by the custom verb
  (`:archive` in the above example), and the verb in the URI **must** match the
  verb in the name of the RPC.
  - If word separation is required, `camelCase` **must** be used.
- The `body` clause in the `google.api.http` annotation **should** be `"*"`.
  - However, if using `GET` or `DELETE`, the `body` clause **must** be absent.
- Custom methods **should** usually take a request message matching the RPC
  name, with a `-Request` suffix.
- Custom methods **should** usually return a response message matching the RPC
  name, with a `-Response` suffix.
  - When operating on a specific resource, a custom method **may** return the
    resource itself.

### Collection-based custom methods

While most custom methods operate on a single resource, some custom methods
**may** operate on a collection instead:

```proto
// Sorts the books from this publisher.
rpc SortBooks(SortBooksRequest) returns (SortBooksResponse) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    post: "/v1/{publisher=publishers/*}/books:sort"
    body: "*"
  };
}
```

- If the collection has a parent, the field name in the request message
  **should** be the target resource's singular noun (`publisher` in the above
  example). If word separators are necessary, `snake_case` **must** be used.
- The collection key (`books` in the above example) **must** be literal.

### Stateless methods

Some custom methods are not attached to resources at all. These methods are
generally _stateless_: they accept a request and return a response, and have no
permanent effect on data within the API.

```proto
// Translates the provided text from one language to another.
rpc TranslateText(TranslateTextRequest) returns (TranslateTextResponse) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    post: "/v1/{project=projects/*}:translateText"
    body: "*"
  };
}
```

- If the method runs in a particular scope (such as a project, as in the above
  example), the field name in the request message **should** be the name of the
  scope resource. If word separators are necessary, `snake_case` **must** be
  used.
- The URI **should** place both the verb and noun after the `:` separator
  (avoid a "faux collection key" in the URI in this case, as there is no
  collection). For example, `:translateText` is preferable to `text:translate`.
- Stateless methods **must** use `POST` if they involve billing.

## Changelog

- **2019-08-01**: Changed the examples from "shelves" to "publishers", to
  present a better example of resource ownership.
