# Jobs

Occasionally, APIs may need to expose a task that takes significant time to
complete, and where a transient [long-running operation][aip-151] is not
appropriate. For example, a task could need to run repeatedly, or have separate
permissions for configuring the task as opposed to running it.

## Guidance

An API **may** define a `Job` resource to represent a particular task with
distinct setup, configuration, and execution:

```proto
message WriteBookJob {
  // The resource name for the writing job.
  string name = 1 [(google.api.resource) = {
    type: "library.googleapis.com/WriteBookJob"
    pattern: "publishers/{publisher}/writeBookJobs/{write_book_job}"
  }];

  // Additional configuration...
}
```

- The name of the resource **must** end with the word "Job".
  - The prefix **should** be a valid RPC name, with a verb and a noun.
- The service **should** define all five of the standard methods ([AIP-131][],
  [AIP-132][], [AIP-133][], [AIP-134][], [AIP-135][]), and use them as the
  primary way to configure the job.

### Run method

The service **should** define a `Run` custom method that executes the job
immediately:

```proto
rpc RunWriteBookJob(RunWriteBookJobRequest)
    returns (google.longrunning.Operation) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    post: "/v1/{name=publishers/*/writingJobs/*}:run"
    body: "*"
  }
  option (google.longrunning.operation_info) = {
    response_type: "RunWriteBookJobResponse"
    metadata_type: "RunWriteBookJobMetadata"
  }
}
```

- The HTTP method **must** be `POST`.
- The method **should** return a [long-running operation][aip-151], which
  **must** resolve to a response message that includes the result of running
  the job.
  - The method **may** use any metadata message it wishes.
- Errors that prevent execution of the job from _starting_ **must** return an
  error response ([AIP-193][]), similar to any other method. Errors that occur
  over the course of the job execution **may** be placed in the metadata
  message. The errors themselves **must** still be represented with a
  [`google.rpc.Status`][] object.

### Executions and results

Ordinarily, the API **should** provide results to the user as the final
response of the `Run` method. However, this is sometimes insufficient; for
example, a job that runs on a recurring schedule in the background can not
deliver results to the user in this way.

The service **may** store resources representing individual executions along
with their result as a sub-collection of resources under the job, which allows
the user to list past job executions. A service that does this **should**
define the `Get`, `List`, and `Delete` methods for the execution resources:

```proto
message WriteBookJobExecution {
  option (google.api.resource) = {
    type: "library.googleapis.com/WriteBookJobExecution"
    pattern: "publishers/{publisher}/writeBookJobs/{write_book_job}/executions/{execution}"
  };

  string name = 1;

  // Other information about the execution, such as metadata, the result,
  // error information, etc.
}
```
