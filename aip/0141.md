# Quantities

Many services need to represent a discrete quantity of items (number of bytes,
number of miles, number of nodes, etc.).

## Guidance

Quantities with a clear unit of measurement (such as bytes, miles, and so on)
**must** include the unit of measurement as the suffix.

```proto
// A representation of a non-stop air route.
message Route {
  // The airport where the route begins.
  string origin = 1;

  // The destination airport.
  string destination = 2;

  // The distance between the origin and destination airports.
  // This value is also used to determine the credited frequent flyer miles.
  int32 distance_miles = 3;
}
```

If the quantity is a number of items (for example, the number of nodes in a
cluster), then the field **should** use the suffix `_count`:

```proto
// A cluster of individual nodes.
message Cluster {
  // The number of nodes in the cluster.
  int32 node_count = 1;
}
```
