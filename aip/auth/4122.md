# Service Account Impersonation

A service account or a user identity in GCP can impersonate another service 
account, and request short-lived credentials on behalf of that service account.

The request can be direct or delegated.

In the direct case, the caller is authenticated as either a Google account or a
service account, and makes a direct request to create short-lived credentials on
behalf of another service account. The requesting identity must have the Service
Account Token Creator role (`roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator`) on the target
service account.

In the delegated case, the caller is also authenticated as either a Google
account or a service account, but the request goes through one or more service
accounts in a delegation chain. Each identity in the chain must grant the Service
Account Token Creator role to the previous identity in the chain. 

**Note:** Because this AIP describes guidance and requirements in a
language-neutral way, it uses generic terminology which may be imprecise or
inappropriate in certain languages or environments.

## Guidance

This section describes the general guidance for supporting Service Account
Impersonation from an auth library to generate OAuth 2.0 access tokens,
OpenID Connect ID tokens, self-signed JSON Web Tokens and self-signed blobs
 on behalf of an impersonated service account.

For instructions on how to configure the correct permissions for impersonation,
please read the [Creating short-lived service account credentials][0] docs.

For general guidance on supporting Service Accounts with Service Account Keys,
please read the [Service Account Keys][1] AIP.

### Generating an OAuth 2.0 access token

#### Parameters

The auth library **must** implement the language-specific abstractions required
to allow a caller to specify the following parameters for a request to generate
an OAuth 2.0 access token on behalf of a service account.

**Source Credentials** - **Required**

The library specific representation of the service/user account requesting
 the impersonation.
 
**Target Principal** - **Required**

The email address of the service account to impersonate, e.g. 
`sa-name@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.

**Scopes** - **Required**

A list of requested OAuth2.0 scopes.

Auth libraries **must** validate that the list of requested scopes is not empty,
and throw an error in that case to save a round trip for a request that would
fail.

**Lifetime** - **Required**

The amount of time until the access token expires, in seconds.
By default, the maximum lifetime for a token is 1 hour (3,600 seconds) and the
value can be extended to 12 hours (43,200 seconds) adding the target service
account to an organization policy that includes
`constraints/iam.allowServiceAccountCredentialLifetimeExtension`.

Auth libraries **must** validate that lifetime doesn't exceed the potential
maximum of 43,200 seconds, and throw an error if it does.

**Delegates** - **Optional**

An ordered list of service account emails in the delegation chain, if used.

#### Expected Behavior

Auth libraries **must** send a POST request to the 
[projects.serviceAccounts.generateAccessToken][2] method, using an access
token generated for the Source Credential to authorize the request:

```
POST https://iamcredentials.googleapis.com/v1/projects/-/serviceAccounts/<TargetPrincipal>:generateAccessToken
```

The request JSON body **must** be of the form:

```json
{
  "delegates": [
    // optional list of delegates
  ],
  "scope": [
    // required list of scopes
  ],
  "lifetime": "lifetime"
}
```

The following is an example of the payload for a direct request for an access
 token with one scope and a lifetime of 300 seconds:

```json
{
  "scope": [
    "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform"
  ],
  "lifetime": "300s" 
}
```

The following is an example of the payload for a delegated request for an access
token with one scope and a lifetime of 300 seconds:

```json
{
  "delegates": [
    "sa-delegate1@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
    "sa-delegate2@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
  ],
  "scope": [
    "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform"
  ],
  "lifetime": "300s"
}
```

### Generating OpenID Connect ID tokens

#### Parameters

The auth library **must** implement the language-specific abstractions required
to allow a caller to specify the following parameters for a request to generate
an Open ID Connect ID token on behalf of a service account.

**Source Credentials** - **Required**

The library specific representation of the service/user account requesting
 the impersonation.
 
**Target Principal** - **Required**

The email address of the service account to impersonate, e.g. 
`sa-name@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.

**Audience** - **Required**

The value of the `aud` field in the ID token.

**Delegates** - **Optional**

An ordered list of service account emails in the delegation chain, if used.

**Include Email** - **Optional**

Whether or not to include the target principal email in the generated ID token.

#### Expected Behavior

Auth libraries **must** send a POST request to the 
[projects.serviceAccounts.generateIdToken][3] method, using an access
token generated for the Source Credential to authorize the request:

```
POST https://iamcredentials.googleapis.com/v1/projects/-/serviceAccounts/<TargetPrincipal>:generateIdToken
```

The request JSON body **must** be of the form:

```json
{
  "delegates": [
    // optional list of delegates
  ],
  "audience": "audience",
  "includeEmail": "true|false"
}
```

The following is an example of the payload for a direct request for an id token
with email included:

```json
{
  "audience": [
    "example-sa@example-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
  ],
  "includeEmail": true 
}
```

The following is an example of the payload for a delegated request for an id 
token with email excluded:

```json
{
  "delegates": [
    "sa-delegate1@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
    "sa-delegate2@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
  ],
  "audience": "example-sa@example-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
}
```

### Creating a self-signed JSON Web Token (JWT)

#### Parameters

The auth library **must** implement the language-specific abstractions required
to allow a caller to specify the following parameters for a request to create a
self signed JWT on behalf of a service account.

**Source Credentials** - **Required**

The library specific representation of the service/user account requesting
 the impersonation.
 
**Target Principal** - **Required**

The email address of the service account to impersonate, e.g. 
`sa-name@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.

**JWT Payload** - **Required**

A JSON object that contains the JWT Claims Set to sign. If the JWT Claims set
contains an `exp` claim and the JWT is used to call a Google API, auth libraries
**must** validate that the `exp` claim is set to no more that 1 hour in the future.

**Delegates** - **Optional**

An ordered list of service account emails in the delegation chain, if used.

#### Expected Behavior

Auth libraries **must** send a POST request to the 
[projects.serviceAccounts.signJwt][4] method, using an access
token generated for the Source Credential to authorize the request:

```
POST https://iamcredentials.googleapis.com/v1/projects/-/serviceAccounts/<TargetPrincipal>:signJWT
```

The request JSON body **must** be of the form:

```json
{
  "delegates": [
    // optional list of delegates
  ],
  "payload": "{ // JWT Claims set }"
}
```

If the request is successful, the response body contains a signed JWT and the 
signing key ID that was used to sign the JWT, as in the following example:

```json
{
  "keyId": "42ba1e...fc0a",
  "signedJwt": "eyJ0eXAi...NiJ9"
}
```

Auth libraries **must** return both to the caller.

### Creating a self-signed blob

#### Parameters

The auth library **must** implement the language-specific abstractions required
to allow a caller to specify the following parameters for a request to create a
self signed blob on behalf of a service account.

**Source Credentials** - **Required**

The library specific representation of the service/user account requesting
 the impersonation.
 
**Target Principal** - **Required**

The email address of the service account to impersonate, e.g. 
`sa-name@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.

**Payload** - **Required**

A JSON object that contains the JWT Claims Set to sign. If the JWT Claims set
contains an `exp` claim and the JWT is used to call a Google API, auth libraries
**must** validate that the `exp` claim is set to no more that 1 hour in the future.

**Delegates** - **Optional**

An ordered list of service account emails in the delegation chain, if used.

#### Expected Behavior

Auth libraries **must** send a POST request to the 
[projects.serviceAccounts.signBlob][5] method, using an access
token generated for the Source Credential to authorize the request:

```
POST https://iamcredentials.googleapis.com/v1/projects/-/serviceAccounts/<TargetPrincipal>:signBlob
```

The request JSON body **must** be of the form:

```json
{
  "delegates": [
    // optional list of delegates
  ],
  "payload": // a base64-encoded string
}
```

Auth libraries **may** provide interfaces to allow the caller to pass the payload
as a string that is already base64 encoded or as a string that is not base64 encoded;
in the latter case, the Auth libraries **must** base64 encode the payload before
sending it in the request.
Base64 encoding implementation **must** follow [RFC4648][6].

If the request is successful, the response body contains a signed blob and the 
signing key ID that was used to sign the JWT, as in the following example:

```json
{
  "keyId": "42ba1e...fc0a",
  "signedBlob": "eyJ0eXAi...NiJ9"
}
```

Auth libraries **must** return both to the caller.
