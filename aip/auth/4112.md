# Service Account Keys

A service account is a special kind of account used by an application or a
virtual machine (VM) instance, not a person. Applications use service accounts
to make authorized API calls, authorized as either the service account itself,
or as Google Workspace or Cloud Identity users through domain-wide delegation. 
Service accounts are associated with private/public RSA key-pairs that are used 
for authentication, which is the focus of this AIP.

**Note:** Because this AIP describes guidance and requirements in a
language-neutral way, it uses generic terminology which may be imprecise or
inappropriate in certain languages or environments.

## Guidance

This section describes the general guidance of supporting Service Account Key
authentication using traditional OAuth flow. For Service Account Key
authentication using self-signed JWT flow, please refer to the [self-signed
JWT][0] AIP.

### Service Account Key Authentication Using OAuth

Under the latest [ADC][1] guidance, when Service Account Key is provided as the
source credential, we prefer to use the [self-signed JWT][0] flow by default,
which does not use the OAuth "scope" argument. Therefore, the client **should**
choose the OAuth flow over self-signed JWT flow only if the OAuth "scope" is
explicitly provided to the client.

### Expected Behavior

To support Service Account Key authentication using OAuth flow, the auth
libraries **must** follow the steps below:

1\. Load the **Service Account ID JSON file** from the file path specified by
**GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS** environment variable, or an explicit
**credentials** file path specified through client options. The JSON file will
look like below:

```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "testproject",
  "private_key_id": "redacted",
  "private_key": "redacted",
  "client_email": "testserviceaccount@test.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "113258942105700140798",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/testserviceaccount%40test.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
}
```

**Note:** A Service Account ID JSON file can be downloaded from [Google Cloud Console][2].

2\. Using any standard JWT library, such as one found at [jwt.io][3], create a
JWT with a header and claims set like the following example:

```json
{
  "alg": "RS256",
  "typ": "JWT",
  "kid": "abcdef1234567890"
}
{
  "iss": "123456-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com",
  "sub": "123456-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com",
  "scope": "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/pubsub",
}
```

* For the `kid` field in the header, specify the service account's private
key ID. You can find this value in the **private_key_id** field of the
service account JSON file.

* For the `iss` and `sub` fields, specify the service account's email
address. You can find this value in the **client_email** field of the
service account JSON file.

* For the `scope` field, specify the **scope** parameter provided by the client.
Multiple scopes can be specified using single space (" ") as delimiter.

3\. Sign the JWT with RSA-256 using the **private_key** found in the service
account JSON file. The output will be used as the request payload (a.k.a.
assertion) for the 2-legged OAuth flow.

4\. Define a parameter "grant_type" as
"urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer". Define a parameter "assertion" as
the payload from step 3.

5\. Make a POST request to the **token_uri** endpoint with the parameters from
step 4 to obtain an OAuth2 Access Token.
