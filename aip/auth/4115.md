# Default Credentials From Google Virtual Machines

If the client runs on Google virtual machine instance such as [Google App
Engine][0] or [Compute Engine][1], the auth library **may** obtain the identity
token that is associated with the instance, and use the identity token as the
credential to access Google APIs. By using the instance identity, the users no
longer need to config their credentials explicitly.

**Note:** Because this AIP describes guidance and requirements in a
language-neutral way, it uses generic terminology which may be imprecise or
inappropriate in certain languages or environments.

## Guidance

This section describes the general guidance of supporting default credentials
from Google virtual machine environments.

### Application Default Credentials

Supporting the default credentials from Google virtual machines is considered as
a part of the [Application Default Credential][2]. To understand the overall
credential flow, please read [AIP-4110][2].

### Google Virtual Machine Environments

There are typically two types of Google virtual machine environments where the
auth library should obtain the identity token based on the environment type:

- Google App Engine Standard 1.0 (aka 1st generation)
- Compute Engine 
  - GCE equivalent runtimes
    - Google App Engine Standard 2.0+
    - Google App Engine Flex
    - Google Cloud Functions
    - Cloud Run
    - Workload Identity on Google Kubernetes Engine

The auth library **should** depend on the [Google App Engine SDK][3] or well 
defined GAE environment variables to detect if the application is running within
the 1st generation Google App Engine environment.

To detect if the application is running on Compute Engine or an equivalent runtime,
the auth library **should** depend on the [Metadata Service Library][4].

### Compute Engine or Equivalent Runtime

If the application runs on a Compute Engine instance (or equivalent runtime),
the auth library can request the following URL to get an access token associated
with instance:

```
http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token
```

In response, the auth library will usually receive a token in the following JSON
format:

```json
{
      "access_token":"YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN",
      "expires_in":3599,
      "token_type":"Bearer"
 }
```

#### Scopes
Access tokens obtained from the metadata server contain the scopes specified at instance creation.
For example, if an instance is granted only the
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/storage-full scope for Cloud Storage, then the tokens obtained 
from the instance's metadata server have only the `storage-full` scope.

When running on GCE, the metadata server ignores requests for custom scopes.
On GCE equivalent runtimes, clients can request a different set of scopes to the metadata server
using the `scopes` url parameter, e.g.:

```
http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token?scopes=comma-separated-list-of-scopes
```

The auth library **should** allow the caller to optionally specify a list of custom scopes,
and add the `scopes` parameter to the request when needed.
Depending on the runtime environment, the request for custom scopes will be transparently
ignored by the server (GCE) or fulfilled (GCE equivalent).

### Google App Engine Standard 1.0 Runtime

If the application runs on a App Engine Standard 1st generation instance, the
auth library **should** rely on the [Google App Engine SDK][3] to retrieve the
access token. Here is [one example][5] in Go. Essentially the SDK relies on the
underlying App Engine Identity service to generate the token.

Like GCE equivalent runtimes, the auth library can specify scopes when requesting the
token in the App Engine Standard 1.0 runtime.

Sample code of getting the access token in Go:

```go
import "google.golang.org/appengine"
...
token, exp, err := appengine.AccessToken(context, scopes...)
...
```

### Token Expiration

The access tokens expire after a short period of time. The auth library **must**
get a new token if the existing token expires.

## Changelog

- **2020-12-14**: Replace note on scopes with more detailed discussion.
- **2021-07-13**: Clarify GCE equivalent runtimes
