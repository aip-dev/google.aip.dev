# Self-signed JWT

Self-signed JWT (JSON Web Token) for Google APIs was introduced in 2014 to
provide a more efficient auth stack for Cloud APIs being accessed via service
accounts by bypassing the intermediate step of exchanging client assertions for
OAuth tokens. A self-signed JWT is a spec-conforming JWT that is locally signed
by the service account private key. Since many Cloud APIs accept self-signed JWT
in place of traditional access tokens, it is now considered a standard
authentication method.

**Note:** Because this AIP describes guidance and requirements in a
language-neutral way, it uses generic terminology which may be imprecise or
inappropriate in certain languages or environments.

## Guidance

This section describes the general guidance of supporting self-signed
JWT as a means of authentication.

### Application Default Credentials

Supporting self-signed JWT is considered a part of [application default
credentials][2]. To understand the overall flow, please read [AIP-4110][2].

### Default Authentication Method For Service Account Keys

Considering its efficiency (bypassing the exchanging step), [ADC][0] **should**
use self-signed JWT as the default authentication flow when service account
key is provided as the source credential.

In other words, [ADC][0] **should** choose the OAuth flow over the self-signed
JWT flow only if the scope is explicitly provided to the auth library.

### Expected Behavior

To support self-signed JWT, the auth libraries **must** follow the steps below:

1\. Load the [service account ID JSON file][2]. Please note that the self-signed
JWT only supports service account ID credential type.

2\. Using any standard JWT library, such as one found at [jwt.io][1], create a JWT
with a header and payload like the following example:

```json
{
  "alg": "RS256",
  "typ": "JWT",
  "kid": "abcdef1234567890"
}
{
  "iss": "123456-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com",
  "sub": "123456-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com",
  "aud": "https://firestore.googleapis.com/",
  "iat": 1511900000,
  "exp": 1511903600
}
```

* For the `kid` field in the header, specify the service account's private key
ID. You can find this value in the `private_key_id` field of the service account
JSON file.

* For the `iss` and `sub` fields, specify the service account's email address.
You can find this value in the `client_email` field of the service account JSON
file.

* For the `aud` field, specify the audience. The default audience value
**should** be `https://[API_ENDPOINT]/`. (e.g. `https://pubsub.googleapis.com/`)

* For the `iat` field, specify the current Unix time, and for the `exp` field,
the value **must** be exactly 3600 seconds later, when the JWT will expire.

3\. Sign the JWT with RSA-256 using the private key found in the service
account JSON file.

## Changelog
