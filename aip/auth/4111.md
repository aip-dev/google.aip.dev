# Self-signed JWT-based Access Token

JWT access token for Google APIs was introduced in 2014 to provide a more
efficient auth stack for Cloud APIs being accessed via service accounts by
bypassing the intermediate step of exchanging client assertions for OAuth
tokens. It becomes a standard authentication method, such that many Cloud APIs
accept JWT-based access tokens that are locally signed by the service account
private key.

**Note:** Because this AIP describes guidance and requirements in a
language-neutral way, it uses generic terminology which may be imprecise or
inappropriate in certain languages or environments.

## Guidance

This section describes the general guidance of supporting a self-signed
JWT-based token.

### Application Default Credentials

Supporting self-signed JWT access token is considered as a part of the [application default credential][2]. To understand the overall flow, please read [AIP-4110][2].

### Default Authentication Method For Service Account Keys

Considering its efficiency (bypassing the exchanging step), [ADC][0] **should**
use self-signed JWT as the default authentication flow for service account
keys.

In other words, [ADC][0] **should** choose the OAuth flow over self-signed JWT
only if the scope is explicitly provided to the auth library.

### Expected Behavior

To support the self-signed JWT-based token, the auth libraries **must** follow
the steps below:

1.  Load the [service account ID JSON file][2]. Please note that the
    self-signed JWT-based token only supports service account ID credential
    type.

2.  Using any standard JWT library, such as one found at [jwt.io][1], create a
    JWT with a header and payload like the following example:

    ```json
    {
      "alg": "RS256",
      "typ": "JWT",
      "kid": "abcdef1234567890"
    }
    {
      "iss": "123456-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com",
      "sub": "123456-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com",
      "aud": "https://firestore.googleapis.com/",
      "iat": 1511900000,
      "exp": 1511903600
    }
    ```

  - For the `kid` field in the header, specify the service account's private
    key ID. You can find this value in the `private_key_id` field of the
    service account JSON file.

  - For the `iss` and `sub` fields, specify the service account's email
    address. You can find this value in the `client_email` field of the
    service account JSON file.

  - For the `aud` field, specify the audience. The default audience value
    **should** be `https://[API_ENDPOINT]/`. (e.g.
    `https://pubsub.googleapis.com/`)

  - For the `iat` field, specify the current Unix time, and for the `exp`
    field, the value **must** be exactly 3600 seconds later, when the JWT
    will expire.

3.  Sign the JWT with RSA-256 using the private key found in the service
    account JSON file.

## Changelog

- **2019-08-13**: Add a section for application default credential.
