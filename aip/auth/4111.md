# Self-signed JWT-based Access Token

JWT access token for Google APIs was introduced in 2014 to provide a more
efficient auth stack for Cloud APIs being accessed via service accounts by
bypassing the intermediate step of exchanging client assertions for OAuth
tokens. It becomes a standard authentication method, such that many Cloud APIs
accept JWT-based access tokens that are locally signed by the service account
private key.

**Note:** Because this AIP describes guidance and requirements in a
language-neutral way, it uses generic terminology which may be imprecise or
inappropriate in certain languages or environments.

## Guidance

This section describes the general guidance of supporting a self-signed
JWT-based token.

### Default Authentication Method For Service Account Keys

Considering its efficiency (bypassing the exchanging step), [ADC][0] **should**
use self-signed JWT as the default authentication flow for service account
keys.

In other words, [ADC][0] **should** choose the OAuth flow over self-signed JWT
only if the scope is explicitly provided to the auth library.

### Expected Behavior

To support the self-signed JWT-based token, the auth libraries **must** follow
the steps below:

1.  Load the [service account ID JSON file][2]. Please note that the
    self-signed JWT-based token only supports service account ID credential
    type.

1.  Using any standard JWT library, such as one found at [jwt.io][1], create a
    JWT with a header and payload like the following example:

        ```json

    { "alg": "RS256", "typ": "JWT", "kid": "abcdef1234567890" } { "iss":
    "123456-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com", "sub":
    "123456-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com", "aud":
    "https://firestore.googleapis.com/", "iat": 1511900000, "exp": 1511903600 }
    ``` _ For the `kid` field in the header, specify the service account's
    private key ID. You can find this value in the `private_key_id` field of
    the service account JSON file. _ For the `iss` and `sub` fields, specify
    the service account's email address. You can find this value in the
    `client_email` field of the service account JSON file. _ For the `aud`
    field, specify the audience. The default audience value **should** be
    `https://[API_ENDPOINT]/`. (e.g. `https://pubsub.googleapis.com/`) _ For
    the `iat` field, specify the current Unix time, and for the `exp` field,
    the value **must** be exactly 3600 seconds later, when the JWT will expire.

1.  Sign the JWT with RSA-256 using the private key found in the service
    account JSON file.
