# Device Certificate Authentication via Mutual TLS

Mutual TLS (a.k.a mTLS) authentication enables authentication of both client and
server identities in a TLS handshake and provides the foundation for Device
Certificate Authentication for Context Aware Access for GCP enterprise
customers. With Device Certificate Authentication, the server takes into account
the client certificate in the transport layer when making authorization
decisions. The use of a client certificate provides a stronger indication of the
access originating from a trusted device. This allows enterprise customers to
restrict access from untrusted devices.

**Note:** Because this AIP describes guidance and requirements in a
language-neutral way, it uses generic terminology which may be imprecise or
inappropriate in certain languages or environments.

## Guidance

This section describes the general guidance of supporting Device Certificate
Authentication (a.k.a. DCA) via mTLS.

### Application Default Credentials for DCA

Users **should** enable DCA through [ADC][0] instead of manual configuration via
client options.

There are two aspects of ADC for DCA. The first is the automatic procurement of
a device certificate. The second is the automatic switching of the service
endpoint to the mTLS version of the service endpoint. Clients **must** support
both of these aspects when supporting ADC for DCA.

### Expected Behavior

Client support for DCA **must** give priority to user overrides specified via
client options. The following decision tree **should** be used:

1.  If user specifies both device certificate and endpoint override via client
    options, use them as is.
1.  If user does not specify device certificate, attempt to procure and use
    a default device certificate.
1.  If user does not specify endpoint override, use the default mTLS endpoint if
    a device certificate is available and the default regular endpoint otherwise.

Implications of the above logic:

1.  If user specifies a non-mTLS endpoint override but a device certificate is
    available, pass along the certificate anyway and let the server decide what
    to do.
1.  If user specifies an mTLS endpoint override but device certificate is not
    available, do not fail-fast, but let server return error when connecting.

The above behavior avoids introducing client-side logic that parses whether the
endpoint override is an mTLS url, since the url pattern may change at anytime.

### Obtaining the Default mTLS Endpoint

The default mTLS endpoint for a service **should** be read from the Discovery
Document field **"mtlsRootUrl"** instead of generated via regex patterns.

### Obtaining the Default Device Certificate via SecureConnect

The default device certificate **should** be procured using the
[EndpointVerification][1] workflow, which fetches the certificate from a
platform-specific credential store (ex. KeyChain in macOS) via a native helper.

Exporting the certificate via the native helper involves executing a **"cert
provider command"** specified in a well-known gcloud metadata file of the
following format:

```json
{
   "version": 1
   "min_cloud_sdk_version": "240.0.0"
   "has_client_cert": true
   "endpoint_verification_error": ""
   "cert_provider_command": "[absolute_path_to_provider_command] --fetch_client_cert"
}
```

For Linux and macOS platforms, the above metadata file is located at
**"~/.secureConnect/context_aware_metadata.json"**.

The cert provider command will print the certificate to stdout, which will be in
the form of an X.509 cert followed immediately by the private key:

  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  Common Name: Google Endpoint Verification
  Valid From: November 10, 2019
  Valid To: November 10, 2020
  Serial Number: 4921083229008411918 (0x444b331faf2dbd0e)
  ...
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
  -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
  ...
  -----END PRIVATE KEY-----

### Obtaining the Default Device Certificate via ECP

The Enterprise Certificate Proxy (ECP) project is the newly recommended way to
procure device certificates. It has two major advantages compared to the legacy
SecureConnect mechanism:

1.  Allows usage of enterprise certs and private keys stored in native keystores and TPMs
    instead of relying on self-signed certs.
1.  Delegates signing operations to keystores, so private keys never leave the security realm.

Please see [ECP Public Documentation][2] for details on ECP configuration.

### Environment Variables

There are situations where the ADC for DCA behavior needs to be modified, such
as for integration testing, or for failsafe. To accomodate those scenarios, the
following environment variables **should** be supported.

**GOOGLE_API_USE_MTLS_ENDPOINT**: If **"always"**, always use mTLS endpoint. If
**"never"**, always use regular endpoint. If **"auto"**, use the default
behavior, which is to use the mTLS endpoint if a device certificate is
available. The default value of this environment variable will be "auto".

**GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE**: If **"true"**, device certificate
authentication will be supported as described in the general guidance. If
**"false"**, the device certificate **must** not be used, even if specified by
the user. The default value **should** be "true" as of May 3, 2024. Users who
wish to disable DCA feature **must** explicitly set this environment variable
to "false".

### Firewall and IP Address Guidance

For any given GCP service, its mTLS endpoint has a different IP address compared
to the non-mTLS endpoint but is expected to fall within the same IP range. The
GCP guidance for IP range management is on a service by service basis. See
[Compute Engine IP Range Documentation][3] for example. In the unlikely event
that an end-user has configured firewall rules based on exact IP addresses
instead of an IP range, they may be impacted by the "auto" mTLS endpoint
upgrade behavior. The best-practice recommendation in this case would be to
avoid adding rules that expect exact IP address matches, and instead use
range-based IP rules following public GCP documentation.

## Changelog

- **2024-11-25*: GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE should default to "true" as of May 3, 2024.
- **2025-02-20*: Add Firewall and IP Address Guidance
