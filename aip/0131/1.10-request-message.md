### Request message

Get methods implement a common request message pattern:

```proto
message GetBookRequest {
  // The name of the book to retrieve.
  // Format: publishers/{publisher}/books/{book}
  string name = 1 [
    (google.api.field_behavior) = REQUIRED,
    (google.api.resource_reference) = {
      type: "library-example.googleapis.com/Book"
    }];
}
```

- A resource name field **must** be included. It **should** be called `name`.
  - The field **should** be annotated as required.
  - The field **should** identify the [resource type][aip-123] that it
    references.
- The comment for the `name` field **should** document the resource pattern.
- The request message **must not** contain any other required fields, and
  **should not** contain other optional fields except those described in
  another AIP.

**Note:** The `name` field in the request object corresponds to the `name`
variable in the `google.api.http` annotation on the RPC. This causes the `name`
field in the request to be populated based on the value in the URL when the
REST/JSON interface is used.
