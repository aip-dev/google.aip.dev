# Resource Revisions

Some APIs need to have resources with a revision history, where users can
reason about the state of the resource over time. There are several reasons for
this:

- Users may want to be able to roll back to a previous revision, or diff
  against a previous revision.
- An API may create data which is derived in some way from a resource at a
  given point in time. In these cases, it may be desirable to snapshot the
  resource for reference later.

## Guidance

APIs **may** store a revision history for a resource if it is useful to users.

APIs implementing resources with a revision history **must** provide a
`revision_id` field on the resource:

```proto
message Book {
  // The name of the book.
  string name = 1;

  // Other fieldsâ€¦

  // The revision ID of the book.
  // This is automatically changed whenever the contents of the book
  // change in any way.
  string revision_id = 5 [(google.api.field_behavior) = OUTPUT_ONLY];
}
```

- The `revision_id` field **should** be a string and contain a short,
  automatically-generated hash. A good rule of thumb is the last eight
  characters of a UUID4.
- The field **must** document when new revisions are created.

### Referencing revisions

When it is necessary to refer to a specific revision of a resource, APIs
**must** use the following syntax: `{resource_name}@{revision_id}`. For
example:

    publishers/123/books/les-miserables@c7cfa2a8

APIs **should** generally accept a resource reference at a particular revision
in any place where they ordinarily accept the resource name, except in
situations that mutate the resource.

**Important:** APIs **must not** require a revision ID, and **must** default to
the current revision if one is not provided, except in methods specifically
dealing with the revision history (such as rollback) where failing to require
it would not make sense.

### Getting a revision

APIs implementing resource revisions **should** accept a resource name with a
revision ID in the standard `Get` method ([AIP-131][]):

```proto
message GetBookRequest {
  // The name of the book.
  //   Example: publishers/123/books/les-miserables
  //
  // In order to retrieve a previous revision of the book, also provide
  // the revision ID.
  //   Example: publishers/123/books/les-miserables@c7cfa2a8
  string name = 1;
}
```

If the user passes a revision ID that does not exist, the API **must** fail
with a `NOT_FOUND` error.

### Listing revisions

APIs implementing resource revisions **should** provide a custom method for
listing the revision history for a resource, with a structure similar to
standard `List` methods ([AIP-132][]):

```proto
rpc ListBookRevisions(ListBookRevisionsRequest)
    returns (ListBookRevisionsResponse) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    get: "/v1/{name=publishers/*/books/*}:listRevisions"
  }
}
```

```proto
message ListBookRevisionsRequest {
  // The name of the book to list revisions for.
  string name = 1;

  // The maximum number of revisions to return per page.
  int32 page_size = 2;

  // The page token, received from a previous ListBookRevisions call.
  // Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page.
  string page_token = 3;
}

message ListBookRevisionsResponse {
  // The revisions of the book.
  repeated BookRevision book_revisions = 1;

  // A token that can be sent as `page_token` to retrieve the next page.
  // If this field is omitted, there are no subsequent pages.
  string next_page_token = 2;
}
```

While revision listing methods are mostly similar to standard `List` methods
([AIP-132][]), the following important differences apply:

- The first field in the request message **must** be called `name` rather than
  `parent` (this is listing revisions for a specific book, not a collection of
  books).
- The URI **must** end with `:listRevisions`.
- Revisions **must** be ordered in reverse chronological order.

The revision object **should** only be used by the revision list method:

```proto
message BookRevision {
  // A representation of the book at this revision.
  // The `name` field always includes an explicit revision ID.
  Book book = 1;

  // The date that this revision was created.
  google.protobuf.Timestamp create_time = 2;
}
```

- Revision objects **should** include a representation of the resource as of
  that revision.
  - The `string name` field in the resource **must** include an explicit
    revision ID.
  - If providing the full resource is expensive or infeasible, the revision
    object **may** include a `string name` field instead, which **must**
    include the resource name and an explicit revision ID.
- Revision objects **must** include the timestamp when the revision was
  created, which **should** be called `create_time`.
- Revision objects **may** include other information, such as a description or
  other metadata, if desired.

### Snapshotting revisions

Depending on the resource, different APIs may have different strategies for
when to snapshot a new revision, such as:

- Snapshot a new revision any time that there is a change
- Snapshot a new revision when something important happens
- Snapshot a new revision when the user specifically asks

APIs **may** use any of these strategies. APIs that want to snapshot a revision
on user request **should** handle this with a `Snapshot` custom method:

```proto
rpc SnapshotBook(SnapshotBookRequest) returns (Book) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    post: "/v1/{name=publishers/*/books/*}:snapshot"
    body: "*"
  }
}
```

- The method **must** use the `POST` HTTP verb.
- The method **should** return the resource, and the resource name **must**
  include the revision ID.

The request message **must** include the `name` field, and **may** include any
additional metadata about the revision (such as a description), which
**should** then be included in revision objects.

### Rollback

A common use case for a resource with a revision history is the ability to roll
back to a given revision. APIs **should** handle this with a `Rollback` custom
method:

```proto
rpc RollbackBook(RollbackBookRequest) returns (Book) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    post: "/v1/{name=publishers/*/books/*}:rollback"
    body: "*"
  }
}
```

- The method **must** use the `POST` HTTP verb.
- The method **should** return the resource, and the resource name **must**
  include the revision ID.

```proto
message RollbackBookRequest {
  // The book being rolled back.
  string name = 1;

  // The revision ID to roll back to.
  // It must be a revision of the same book.
  //
  //   Example: c7cfa2a8
  string revision_id = 2;
}
```

- The request message **must** include a `revision_id` field.
  - The API **must** fail the request with `NOT_FOUND` if the revision does not
    exist on that resource.

**Note:** When rolling back, the API should return a _new_ revision of the
resource with a _new_ revision ID, rather than reusing the original ID. This
avoids problems with representing the same revision being active for multiple
ranges of time.
