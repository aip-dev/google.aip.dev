# Batch Create

Some APIs need to allow users to create multiple resources in a single
transaction. A batch create method provides this functionality.

## Guidance

APIs **may** support Batch Create using the following pattern:

```proto
rpc BatchCreateBooks(BatchCreateBooksRequest) returns (BatchCreateBooksResponse) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    post: "/v1/shelves/-/books:batchCreate"
    body: "*"
  };
}
```

- The RPC's name **must** begin with `BatchCreate`. The remainder of
  the RPC name **should** be the plural form of the resource being created.
- The request and response messages **must** match the RPC name, with `-Request`
  and `-Response` suffixes.
  - However, in the event that the request may take a significant amount of
    time, the response message **must** be a `google.longrunning.Operation`
    which ultimately resolves to the `-Response` type.
- The HTTP verb **must** be `POST`.
- The HTTP URI **must** end with `:batchCreate`.
- The URL path **should** represent the collection for the resource, matching
  the collection used for simple CRUD operations. If the operation spans
  parents, a dash (`-`) **may** be used as a wildcard.
- The body clause in the `google.api.http` annotation **should** be `"*"`.
- The operation **should** be atomic: it **should** fail for all resources or
  succeed for all resources (no partial success).

### Request message

The request for a batch create method **should** be specified with the following pattern:

```proto
message BatchCreateBookRequest {
  // The request message specifying the resources to create.
  // A maximum of 1000 books can be created in a batch.
  repeated CreateBookRequest requests = 1;
}
```

- The request message **must** include one repeated field which accepts the
  request messages specifying the resources to create, as specified for
  [standard Create methods][request-message]. The field **should** be named
  `requests`.
- The request message **must not** contain any other required fields, and
  **should not** contain other optional fields except those described in this or
  another AIP.
- The comment above the names field **should** document the maximum number of
  requests allowed.

### Response message

The response for a batch create method **should** be specified with the
following pattern:

```proto
message BatchCreateBooksResponse {
  // Books created.
  repeated Book books = 1;
}
```

- The response message **must** include one repeated field corresponding to the
  resources that were created.
