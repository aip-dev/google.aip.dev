# Standard Field Codes

Standard fields are defined in AIP-148. At Kolla, where we use many generators to scaffold our API manifests,
it is helpful to further define opinions like the Proto codes and placement of the standard timestamps fields 
for consistency in reading API manifests.

## Guidance

Standard fields with timestamps (e.g. create_time) **should** be at the end of a resource message.

Standard fields with timestamps **should** be numbered as follows:

```proto
    // create time
    google.protobuf.Timestamp create_time = 90 [(google.api.field_behavior) = OUTPUT_ONLY];
    // time of last update
    google.protobuf.Timestamp update_time = 91 [(google.api.field_behavior) = OUTPUT_ONLY];
    // delete time (for soft deleting)
    google.protobuf.Timestamp delete_time = 92 [(google.api.field_behavior) = OUTPUT_ONLY];
    // expire time says when to do the hard delete after the soft delete
    google.protobuf.Timestamp expire_time = 93 [(google.api.field_behavior) = OUTPUT_ONLY];
```

Standard field `uid` **should** be the second element of a resource:

```proto
message Test {
    //...
    // name ID of the APP ;-)
    string name = 1;
    // The system ID of the resource
    string uid = 2 [(google.api.field_behavior) = OUTPUT_ONLY];
    //...
}
```
