# OpenAPI Functionality

At Kolla we often generate OpenAPI manifests from our proto files. We have added some
special formatting rules to help make the generated OpenAPI manifest better for documentation
and general functionality.

## Guidance

RPC methods **should** have a comment with a pipe character. The summary for the method
**must** go on the left side of the pipe character and the description on the right.

```proto
// Update Message Summary | This function updates a message.
rpc UpdateMessage(Message) returns(Message) {
    option(google.api.http) = {
        patch: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
        body: "text"
    };
}
```
