# Common components

In general, API reviewers encourage API producers to keep their APIs mostly
self-contained, except for a relatively small set of common protos which are
safe to import (e.g. [`google.protobuf.Timestamp`][timestamp]). This is for
good reason: APIs generally need to be able to move forward independently of
one another, and mutual dependencies can cause downstream APIs to be forced
into taking major version changes or even lead to dependency conflicts.

However, there are also cases where common structures are valuable, especially
where a concept is well-known and it is sufficiently clear that it will not
change. Common protos serve this use case.

## Guidance

The public representation of APIs **should** be self-contained, meaning that
all protos used by the API originate in the same proto `package`, except for
common protos, which **may** be used freely in any API.

APIs **must not** define a set of API-specific common protos which live outside
of its versioning structure. This prevents independent movement of particular
versions and also causes problems for client libraries in many languages that
compile the proto messages into classes.

APIs **should not** directly depend on protos defined in other APIs. Instead,
they should copy and paste the applicable messages into their own API. When
doing so, APIs **should** keep the field names and numbers the same.

## Existing common protos

The common protos, which public-facing protos for an API **may** safely import,
are as follows:

- [`google.api.http`](https://github.com/googleapis/api-common-protos/blob/master/google/api/http.proto)
- [`google.longrunning.Operation`](https://github.com/googleapis/api-common-protos/blob/master/google/longrunning/operations.proto)
- [`google.protobuf.*`](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/tree/master/src/google/protobuf)
- [`google.rpc.Code`](https://github.com/googleapis/api-common-protos/blob/master/google/rpc/code.proto)
- [`google.rpc.Status`](https://github.com/googleapis/api-common-protos/blob/master/google/rpc/status.proto)
- [`google.type.*`][type]

Note that some common protos may have internal-only fields. APIs **should**
generally only rely on fields which have been
[released into open source](https://github.com/googleapis/api-common-protos).

Google APIs **may** also import [`google.iam.v1.*`][iam], which provides the
IAM messages used throughout Google.

**Note:** Many APIs also import protos from other packages for internal-only
use (e.g. to apply visibility labels or provide instructions to internal
infrastructure). This is acceptable provided that the _public_ protos do not
contain such references.

### Protobuf types

The `google.protobuf` package is somewhat special in that it is shipped with
protocol buffers itself, rather than with API tooling. (For most API designers,
this should be an implementation detail).

This package includes a small library of types useful for representing common
programming language constructs:

- [`google.protobuf.Duration`][duration]: Durations, with nanosecond-level
  precision. The protobuf runtime provides helper functions to convert to and
  from language-native duration objects where applicable (such as Python's
  [`timedelta`][timedelta]).
- [`google.protobuf.Struct`][struct]: JSON-like structures (a dictionary of
  primitives, lists, and other dictionaries). The protobuf runtime provides
  helper functions in most languages to convert struct objects to and from
  JSON.
- [`google.protobuf.Timestamp`][timestamp]: Timestamps, with nanosecond-level
  precision. The protobuf runtime provides helper functions in most languages
  to convert to and from language-native timestamp objects (such as Python's
  [`datetime`][datetime]).

### API Types

The `google.type` package provides a "standard library" of types useful for
representing common concepts in APIs. While types are added from time to time
and the definitive list is always [the code][type], several types deserve note:

- [`google.type.Color`][color]: RGB or RGBA colors.
- [`google.type.Date`][date]: Calendar dates, with no time or time zone
  component.
- [`google.type.DayOfWeek`][day_of_week]: The day of the week, with no other
  date, time, or time zone component.
- [`google.type.LatLng`][lat_lng]: Geographic coordinates.
- [`google.type.Money`][money]: Currency.
- [`google.type.PostalAddress`][postal_address]: Postal addresses in most
  countries.
- [`google.type.TimeOfDay`][time_of_day]: Wall-clock time, with no date or time
  zone component.

## Appendix: Adding to common protos

Occasionally, it may be useful to add protos to these packages or to add to the
list of commonly-available protos. In order to do this, [open an issue][] on
the AIP repository in GitHub.

However, some general guidelines are worth noting for this:

- Protos **should** only be promoted to common status if we are certain that
  they will never change (at all -- even in ways that would normally be
  considered backwards compatible). Common protos are generally not versioned,
  and it must be the case that we can rely on the proto to be a complete and
  accurate representation indefinitely.
  - The exception to this is protos describing our infrastructure, which
    **may** have rare, backwards-compatible changes.
- Protos must be applicable to a significant number of APIs for consideration
  as common protos. It is okay for those APIs to be clustered together (e.g.
  all in a single PA).
- There is no good way to "stage" a common proto, because moving references to
  them is effectively not possible. (In other words, it is infeasible to add a
  proto to `google.geo.type.*` and then "graduate" it to `google.type.*`
  later.)
- Adding a common proto requires coordination between several teams, and it may
  take time between when an addition is approved and when it is available for
  use.
- Even after a common proto is added, APIs using local versions must continue
  to do so until they go to the next major version.

In the event that you believe adding a common proto is appropriate, please
[open an issue][].
