# Standard methods: Delete

In REST APIs, it is customary to make a `DELETE` request to a resource's URI
(for example, `/v1/shelves/{shelf}/books/{book}`) in order to delete that
resource.

Resource-oriented design ([AIP-121][]) honors this pattern through the
`Delete` method. These RPCs accept the URI representing that resource and
usually return an empty response.

## Guidance

APIs **should** generally provide a delete method for resources unless it is
not valuable for users to do so.

Delete methods are specified using the following pattern:

```proto
rpc DeleteBook(DeleteBookRequest) returns (google.protobuf.Empty) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    delete: "/v1/{name=shelves/*/books/*}"
  };
}
```

- The RPC's name **must** begin with the word `Delete`. The remainder of the
  RPC name **should** be the singular form of the resource's message name.
- The request message **must** match the RPC name, with a `-Request` suffix.
- The response message **should** be `google.protobuf.Empty`. However, if the
  resource will take time to delete (see below), the response message **may**
  be the resource itself. There is no `DeleteBookResponse`.
- The HTTP verb **must** be `DELETE`.
- The request message field receiving the resource name **should** map to the
  URL path.
  - This field **should** be called `name`.
  - The `name` field **should** be the only variable in the URI path. All
    remaining parameters **should** map to URI query parameters.
- There **must not** be a `body` key in the `google.api.http` annotation.

The Delete method **should** succeed if and only if a resource was present and
was successfully deleted. If the resource did not exist, the method **should**
send a `NOT_FOUND` error.

### Request message

Delete methods implement a common request message pattern:

```proto
message DeleteBookRequest {
  // The name of the book to delete.
  // Format: shelves/{shelf}/books/{book}
  string name = 1;
}
```

- A `name` field **must** be included. It **should** be called `name`.
- The comment for the field **should** document the resource pattern.

### Soft delete

Delete methods **may** simply mark the resource as having been deleted, but not
completely remove it from the system. If the method behaves this way, it
**should** return the updated resource.

Soft-deleted resources **should not** show up in [list][aip-131] requests by
default (unless `bool show_deleted` is true).

APIs that soft delete resources may choose a reasonable strategy for purging
those resources, including automatic purging after a reasonable time (such as
30 days), allowing users to [set an expiry time][aip-214], or retaining the
resources indefinitely.

### Batch delete

Some APIs need to allow users to delete multiple resources at once. APIs
**may** implement a "batch delete" [custom method][aip-136], which **must** use
the `POST` HTTP verb (not `DELETE`).

```proto
rpc BatchDeleteBooks(BatchDeleteBooksRequest) returns (google.protobuf.Empty) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    post: "/v1/{parent=shelves/*}/books:batchDelete"
  };
}
```

```proto
message BatchDeleteBooksRequest {
  // Required. The shelf containing the books.
  // Format: shelves/{shelf}
  string parent = 1;

  // Required. The IDs of the books to delete.
  repeated string book_ids = 1;
}
```

Batch delete **must** be implemented to take a list of resource names, and
**must not** allow filter-based matching (which makes it very easy for users to
accidentally delete important data).

Batch deletes **should** be atomic: either the entire request succeeds, or none
of it does. Partial failures **should not** be supported.

### Cascading deletes

Sometimes, it may be necessary for users to be able to delete a resource as
well as all applicable child resources. However, since deletion is usually
permanent, it is also important that users not do so accidentally, as
reconstructing wiped-out child resources may be quite difficult.

If an API allows deletion of a resource that may have child resources, the API
**should** provide a `bool force` field on the request, which the user sets to
explicitly opt in to a cascading delete.

```proto
message DeleteShelfRequest {
  // The name of the shelf to delete.
  // Format: shelves/{shelf}
  string name = 1;

  // If set to true, any books on this shelf will also be deleted.
  // (Otherwise, the request will only work if the shelf is empty.)
  bool force = 2;
}
```

The API **must** fail with an error if the `force` field is not set and child
resources are present.

### Protected deletes

Sometimes, it may be necessary for users to ensure that no changes have been
made to a resource that is being deleted. If a resource provides an [etag][],
the delete request **may** accept the etag (as either required or optional):

```proto
message DeleteBookRequest {
  // The name of the book to delete.
  // Format: shelves/{shelf}/books/{book}
  string name = 1;

  // Optional. The etag of the book.
  // If this is provided, it must match the server's etag.
  string etag = 2;
}
```

If the etag is provided and does not match the server-computed etag, the
request **must** fail with a `FAILED_PRECONDITION` error code.
