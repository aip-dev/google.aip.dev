# Batch methods: Get

Some APIs need to allow users to get a specific set of resources at a consistent
time point (e.g. using a read transaction). A batch get method provides this
functionality.

## Guidance

APIs **may** support Batch Get using the following pattern:

```proto
rpc BatchGetBooks(BatchGetBooksRequest) returns (BatchGetBooksResponse) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    get: "/v1/{parent=shelves/*}/books:batchGet"
  };
}
```

- The RPC's name **must** begin with `BatchGet`. The remainder of the
  RPC name **should** be the plural form of the resource being retrieved.
- The request and response messages **must** match the RPC name, with `-Request`
  and `-Response` suffixes.
- The HTTP verb **must** be `GET`.
- The HTTP URI **must** end with `:batchGet`.
- The URL path **should** represent the collection for the resource, matching
  the collection used for simple CRUD operations. If the operation spans
  parents, a dash (`-`) **may** be accepted as a wildcard.
- There **must not** be a body key in the `google.api.http` annotation.
- The operation **must** be atomic: it **must** fail for all resources or
  succeed for all resources (no partial success).
  - If the operation covers multiple locations and at least one location is
    down, the operation **must** fail.

### Request message

The request for a batch get method **should** be specified with the following
pattern:

```proto
message BatchGetBooksRequest {
  // The parent resource shared by all books being retrieved.
  // Format: shelves/{shelf}
  // If this is set, the parent field in the GetBookRequest messages
  // must either be empty or match this field.
  string parent = 1;

  // The requests specifying the books to retrieve.
  // A maximum of 1000 books can be retreived in a batch.
  repeated GetBookRequest requests = 2;
}
```

- A `parent` field **should** be included. If a caller sets this field,
  and the `parent` field of any child request message does not match, the
  request **must** fail. The `parent` field of child request messages can be
  omitted if the `parent` field in this request is set.
  - This field **should** be required if only 1 parent per request is allowed.
- The request message **must** include a repeated field which accepts the
  request messages specifying the resources to retrieve, as specified for
  [standard Get methods][request-message]. The field **should** be named
  `requests`.
- Other fields **may** be "hoisted" from the
  [standard Get request][request-message], which means that the field can be
  set at either the batch level or child request level. Similar to `parent`,
  if both the batch level and child request level are set for the same field,
  the values **must** match.
- Batch get **should not** support pagination because transactionality across
  API calls would be extremely difficult to implement or enforce, and the
  request defines the exact scope of the response anyway.
- The request message **must not** contain any other required fields, and
  **should not** contain other optional fields except those described in this or
  another AIP.
- The comment above the names field **should** document the maximum number of
  requests allowed.

### Response message

The response for a batch get method **should** be specified with the following
pattern:

```proto
message BatchGetBooksResponse {
  // Books requested.
  repeated Book books = 1;
}
```

- The response message **must** include one repeated field corresponding to the
  resources being retrieved.
- The order of books in the response **must** be the same as the names in the
  request.
