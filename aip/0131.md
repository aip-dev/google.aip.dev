# Standard methods: Get

In REST APIs, it is customary to make a `GET` request to a resource's URI (for
example, `/v1/shelves/{shelf}/books/{book}`) in order to retrieve that
resource.

Resource-oriented design ([AIP-121][]) honors this pattern through the `Get`
method. These RPCs accept the URI representing that resource and return the
resource.

## Guidance

APIs **should** generally provide a get method for resources unless it is not
valuable for users to do so. The purpose of the get method is to return data
from a single resource.

Get methods are specified using the following pattern:

```proto
rpc GetBook(GetBookRequest) returns (Book) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    get: "/v1/{name=shelves/*/books/*}"
  };
}
```

- The RPC's name **must** begin with the word `Get`. The remainder of the RPC
  name **should** be the singular form of the resource's message name.
- The request message **must** match the RPC name, with a `-Request` suffix.
- The response message **must** be the resource itself. (There is no
  `GetBookResponse`.)
- The HTTP verb **must** be `GET`.
- The URI **should** contain a single variable field corresponding to the
  resource name.
  - This field **should** be called `name`.
  - The URI **should** have a variable corresponding to this field.
  - The `name` field **should** be the only variable in the URI path. All
    remaining parameters **should** map to URI query parameters.
- There **must not** be a `body` key in the `google.api.http` annotation.

### Request message

Get methods implement a common request message pattern:

```proto
message GetBookRequest {
  // The name of the book to retrieve.
  // Format: shelves/{shelf}/books/{book}
  string name = 1;
}
```

- A resource name field **must** be included. It **should** be called `name`.
- The comment for the `name` field **should** document the resource pattern.
- The request message **must not** contain any other required fields, and
  **should not** contain other optional fields except those described in
  another AIP.

**Note:** The `name` field in the request object corresponds to the `name`
variable in the `google.api.http` annotation on the RPC. This causes the `name`
field in the request to be populated based on the value in the URL when the
REST/JSON interface is used.

## Changelog

- **2019-05-29**: Added an explicit prohibition on arbitrary fields in standard
  methods.
