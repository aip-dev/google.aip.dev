# Unreachable resources

Occasionally, a user may ask for a list of resources, and some set of resources
in the list are temporarily unavailable. For example, a user may ask to list
resources across multiple locations, but one of those locations is temporarily
down. In this situation, it is still desirable to give the user as much as
possible, while indicating that something is missing.

## Guidance

If a method to retrieve data is capable of partially failing due to one or more
resources being temporarily unreachable, the response message **must** include
a field to indicate this:

```proto
// The request message for ListBooks.
message ListBooksRequest {
  // The publisher to list books from.
  // To list books across all publishers, use "publishers/-".
  string parent = 1;

  // Other fields...
}

message ListBooksResponse {
  // The books matching the request.
  repeated Book books = 1;

  // The next page token, if there are more books matching the
  // request.
  string next_page_token = 2;

  // Unreachable resources. If any books that would match the
  // request were not included (for example, because one publisher's
  // API was down), the unreachable resources are listed here.
  repeated string unreachable = 3;
}
```

- The field **must** be a repeated string, and **should** be named
  `unreachable`.
- The field **must** be set to the names of the resources which are the cause
  of the issue, such as the locations or resources that could not be reached.
  - The response **must not** provide any other information about the issue.
  - The service **must** provide a way for the user to get an error with
    additional information, and **should** allow the user to repeat the
    original call with more restrictive parameters in order to do so.

**Important:** If a single unreachable location or resource prevents returning
any data by definition (for example, a list request for a single publisher
where that publisher's API is down), the service **must** fail the entire
request with an error.

### Pagination

When paginating over a list, it is likely that the service will not know that
there are unreachable locations or resources initially.

- The response **may** provide the unreachable location or resource in the
  `unreachable` field on the page where it is initially encountered.
- The response **must** provide any outstanding unreachable locations or
  resources in the `unreachable` field on the final page.
  - If a location or resource was unreachable during pagination, but the
    service tried again and it became reachable and the data was provided to
    the user on a later page, the final page's `unreachable` field **must not**
    include the intermittently-unreachable location or resource.
