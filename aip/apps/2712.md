# API completeness

Our customers expect that they can be as productive in their Apps programs as
they can be sitting at the UI. When they can not, this is surprising and
disappointing. Historically, Google Workspace has not insisted on this kind of
completeness. However, we want to move towards that goal, hence this
requirement for a plan, while we only advise completeness itself.

For major changes, however, the desire for completeness will be amplified.

## Guidance

Each action that can be performed in the UI **should** be possible to do via a
public API. For example, if there is a button in the UI to add a widget, there
**should** be some way to add a widget using the API. This simplifies the
user's understanding of the API, and makes it easier to record UI actions to be
replayed via the API.

The question of _when_ the completeness ought to be achieved is not fixed. Each
team **must** have a plan for API completeness, even if it is a simple
statement, such as, "When we are given resources to do so." (We would prefer
more, but if that is your plan, then so be it.)
