# One team owns each type

This guidance supplements [AIP-213][].

Sharing types is tempting, and it is possible. However, it is surrounded by
some complicated issues.

We will consider making shared types for classes that are useful across
multiple Apps APIs, we just will not do it lightly. If you feel you have a case
for this, please contact us at apps-api-reviewers@google.com.

## Guidance

Each API owns its own types.

If your API needs to reference another API's objects, your API **must** contain
a reference ([resource name][aip-122] or ID) that can be used to get the
information from that other API. For example, if your API wants to reference a
relevant Gmail message, you **must** store a Gmail message name, and the
message itself will be accessed via the Gmail API, passing in that name. Your
API **must not** contain an actual Gmail message object.

For smaller types, it is also reasonable to make a copy of the class.

[aip-122]: ../0122.md
[aip-213]: ../0213.md
