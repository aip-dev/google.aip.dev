# Common service client mix-ins

An API platform often has utility services that are shared amongst the discrete
product services. These common services each have a centrally-defined surface,
but individual instances are hosted alongside each product service. Thus, the
surfaces of each common services hosted by the product service are "mixed in" at
runtime.


## Guidance

Client libraries **may** provide client methods for the common services declared
to be mixed-in by a product service. Such methods improve the user experience by
presenting the mix-in methods from a client configured to communicate with the
product service that hosts the mix-in service.

Should client libraries support mix-in services, the common services that
**must** be supported include:

- `google.cloud.location.Locations`
- `google.iam.v1.IAMPolicy`
- `google.longrunning.Operations`

**Note:** The list of supported mix-in services and the mix-in services
themselves change infrequently. Any new common service to be supported should be
added to the list here and generators should be updated.

A mix-in service **must** be declared in the [`apis`] in a
[`google.api.Service`] to be generated into a client library. Furthermore, it
**must** have [`google.api.Http`] bindings declared for each of its RPC's in the
[`http`] configuration of the same [`google.api.Service`] (more details on these
bindings in [AIP-127]).


### Implementing mix-in support

#### Generator configuration

Client library generators **must** accept the file path of a
[`google.api.Service`] in YAML form. This flag **must** be optional - meaning
the flag **must not** be required for basic client generation that omits the
mix-in methods.

#### Mix-in API client configuration

If a mix-in API utilizes client library configuration such as
`google.api.method_signature` or request header injection, generators **may**
support it in the generated mix-in methods if the configuration is accessible.

#### Multiple host service clients

If there are multiple services defined by the host API that would result in
multiple clients being generated, generators **should** include the mix-in
methods on all eligible, generated service clients.

#### Overriding a duplicate RPC

Client library generators **must not** generate a mix-in method on a host
service client if that service already defines an RPC with the same name. For
example, take the following service definition:

```proto
service LibraryService {
    rpc ListBooks(ListBookRequest) returns (ListBooksResponse);

    // Other host API RPCs...

    // Redefinitions of the google.iam.v1.IAMPolicy mix-in service.
    rpc GetIamPolicy(google.iam.v1.GetIamPolicyRequest) returns (google.iam.v1.Policy);

    rpc SetIamPolicy(google.iam.v1.SetIamPolicyRequest) returns (google.iam.v1.Policy);

    rpc TestIamPermissions(google.iam.v1.TestIamPermissionsRequest) returns (google.iam.v1.TestIamPermissionsResponse);
}
```

Should the host API declare the `google.iam.v1.IAMPolicy` as a mix-in service,
client library generators **must not** override the methods generated for the
same RPCs already defined in the `LibraryService` on its client with mix-in
methods.
