# Version-aware clients

APIs can annotate services with [`google.api.api_version`][]. If
`google.api.api_version` is specified, version-aware clients **must**
include the value of `google.api.api_version` in the request to the API.

### Expected Generator and Client Library Behavior

If a service is annotated with `google.api.api_version`, client library
generators **must** include the version in requests sent to the API via
the HTTP Header `X-Goog-Api-Version`.

Requests which contain the API version, **must** include either an HTTP query
parameter `$apiVersion` or HTTP header `X-Goog-Api-Version`, but a request
**must not** contain both.

Generated documentation for a given service **may** include the value of
`google.api.api_version`, if it exists in the source protos.

## Rationale

The `google.api.api_version` annotation allows services to abide by the schema and
behavior of the service at the time that the API version was deployed. The format of the
API version **must** be treated as opaque by clients. Generators and clients **must not**
interpret the value of `google.api.api_version` beyond the uses mentioned above.
