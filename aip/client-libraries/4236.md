# Version-aware clients

APIs may choose to annotate services with [google.api.api_version]. If 
[google.api.api_version] is specified, version-aware clients **must** include
the value of [google.api.api_version] in the request to the API. This allows
services to abide by the schema and behavior of the service at the time that
this API version was deployed. The format of the API version must be treated
as opaque by clients. Services may use a format with an apparent structure,
but clients must not rely on this to determine components within an API version,
or attempt to construct other valid API versions.

### Expected Generator and Client Library Behavior

If a service is annotated with [google.api.api_version], client library
generators **must** include the version in requests sent to the API via
the HTTP Header `X-Goog-Api-Version`.

For HTTP Requests, an HTTP Query Parameter `$apiVersion` can be used
instead of the `X-Goog-Api-Version` HTTP header.

Requests which contain the API version, must include either an HTTP query
parameter `$apiVersion` or HTTP header `X-Goog-Api-Version`, but not both.

Generated documentation for a given service can include the value of
[google.api.api_version], if it exists in the source protos.

The format of the API version must be treated as opaque by clients. Generators
and clients must not use the value of [google.api.api_version] to make decisions.
