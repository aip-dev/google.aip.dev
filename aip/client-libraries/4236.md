# Version-aware clients

APIs can annotate services with [`google.api.api_version`][]. If
`google.api.api_version` is specified, version-aware clients **must**
include the value of `google.api.api_version` in the request to the API.

### Expected Generator and Client Library Behavior

If a service is annotated with `google.api.api_version`, client library
generators **must** include either an HTTP query parameter `$apiVersion`
or HTTP header `X-Goog-Api-Version`, but a request **must not** contain both.

Generated documentation for a given service **may** include the value of
`google.api.api_version`, if it exists in the source protos.

Clients **must** treat the value of `google.api.api_version` as opaque to ensure
robust compatibility.  This means that the specific format or structure of the
version string **must not** be parsed or interpreted for any purpose beyond identifying
the intended API version.

## Rationale

### Necessity for Versioning

Explicit API versioning using the `google.api.api_version` annotation is essential
for maintaining compatibility between clients and services over time. As services
evolve, their schemas and behaviors may change. By specifying the API version, a
client communicates its expectations to the service. This allows the service to
respond in a manner consistent with the client's understanding, preventing errors
or unexpected results due to incompatible changes.

### Importance of Opaque Treatment

Treating the `google.api.api_version` value as opaque is important for ensuring robust
compatibility guarantees. By relying on this opaque identifier, clients avoid making
assumptions about the underlying versioning scheme, which may change independently of
the API itself. This flexibility allows service providers to evolve their versioning
strategies without impacting client compatibility.

### Mutual Exclusivity of Query and Header

Both the query parameter and header mechanisms exist to provide flexibility for different
client environments. However, allowing both simultaneously could lead to ambiguity if the
values differ. To ensure consistent version identification and prevent potential conflicts,
only one mechanism should be used at a time.
