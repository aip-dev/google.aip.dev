# Routing headers

In some situations, a gRPC API backend is able to route traffic more
efficiently if it knows about some values in the request; however, the request
payload can not be reasonably deconstructed on the wire to perform that
routing.

## Guidance

Code generators **should** look at URL-based variables declared in the
[`google.api.http`][http] annotation and transcribe these into the
`x-goog-request-params` header in unary calls. A URL-based variable is a
variable declared as a key in curly braces in the URI string. For example:

```proto
rpc CreateTopic(CreateTopicRequest) {
  option (google.api.http).post = "{parent=projects/*}/topics";
}
```

In this case, the applicable variable is `parent`, and it refers to the
`parent` field in `CreateTopicRequest`. When the user provides an instance of
`CreateTopicRequest` to the method (or once the client library has built it, in
the case of method overloads), the client library must extract the key and
value, and append them to the `x-goog-request-params` header. Both the key and
the value **must** be URL-encoded per [RFC 6570 §3.2.2][]. This can be done
with standard library URL encoding. For example, adding this header to a gRPC
request in Go:

```go
md := metadata.Pairs("x-goog-request-params",
  url.QueryEscape("parent") + "=" + url.QueryEscape(req.GetParent()))
```

Much like URL parameters, if there is more than one key-value pair, the `&`
character is used as the separator. At runtime, if a named parameter is unset on
the request message, it **should not** be included in the headers.

If the [`google.api.http`][http] annotation contains `additional_bindings`,
these patterns **should** be parsed for additional request parameters. Fields
not duplicated in the top-level (or `additional_bindings`) pattern **should** be
included in request parameters, encoded in the same way.

**Note:** There is no additional annotation used for this; the presence of the
key in any of the standard fields (`get`, `post`, `put`, `patch`, `delete`) on
the [`google.api.http`][http] annotation is sufficient.
