# Routing headers

In some situations, a gRPC API backend is able to route traffic more
efficiently if it knows about some values in the request; however, the request
payload can not be reasonably deconstructed on the wire to perform that
routing.

## Guidance

Code generators should look at URL-based variables declared in the
[`google.api.http`][http] annotation and transcribe these into the
`x-goog-request-params` header in unary calls. A URL-based variable is a
variable declared as a key in curly braces in the URI string. For example:

```proto
rpc CreateTopic(CreateTopicRequest) {
  option (google.api.http).post = "{parent=projects/*}/topics";
}
```

In this case, the applicable variable is `parent`, and it refers to the
`parent` field in `CreateTopicRequest`. When the user provides an instance of
`CreateTopicRequest` to the method (or once the client library has built it, in
the case of method overloads), the client library should then extract the key
and value, URL-encode them, and append them to the `x-goog-request-params`
header. Much like URL parameters, if there is more than one key-value pair, the
`&` character is used as the separator.

**Note:** There is no additional annotation used for this; the presence of the
key in any of the standard fields (`get`, `post`, `put`, `patch`, `delete`) on
the [`google.api.http`][http] annotation is sufficient.
