# Automatically populate fields in the request message

For APIs that leverage request idempotency as described via [AIP-155], APIs may
choose to have the client libraries automatically populate fields such as
`request_id` if they are not already set by the customer.

**Note:** This feature is primarily written for `request_id` fields within the
request message. Nonetheless, this feature **must** work for a field of any
name, as long as the conditions below hold true.

## Guidance

APIs **may** configure fields in the request message for automatic population.
For a field to be automatically populated, **all** the conditions below
**must** be true:

- The field **must** be of type `string`
- The field **must** be at the top-level of the request message
- The RPC **must** be a unary RPC (i.e. streaming RPCs are not supported)
- The field **must not** be annotated
  with [`google.api.field_behavior = REQUIRED`][required].
- The field **must** be annotated
  with [`google.api.field_info.format = UUID4`][uuid4].
- The field name **must** be listed
  in the [`google.api.MethodSettings.auto_populated_fields`][apf] entry
  in [`google.api.Publishing.method_settings`][apf]
  for the target method.

### Expected Generator and Client Library Behavior

If the aforementioned requirements are met for a given field, client library
generators **must** enable automatic population of said field in the
generated client.

The field **must** be automatically populated if and only if one of the
following conditions holds:

- The field supports explicit presence, and has **not** been set by the user
- The field doesn't support explicit presence, and its value is the empty
  string (i.e. the default value)

If a field is specified in the `auto_populated_fields`, but does not meet the
structural requirements, the client library generators **must not** enable
automatic population for that field. Client library generators **may** emit an
error during generation.

Client libraries **must** reuse automatically populated values for retries of
the same request. In other words, the automatically populated fields
**must not** be regenerated for each RPC attempt with the same request message.
