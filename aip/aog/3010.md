# Actions on Google Vertical Integration Webhook Format

If an action is part of a vertical program that requires a webhook for Google
to integrate with the action, the webhook format **must** follow this AIP.

## Guidance

### Custom method name

Custom methods in a vertical program are defined by Google and implemented by
third-party actions. Guidelines related to names of custom methods in
[AIP-136](../0136.md) **should** be applied.

- The name of the method **should** be a verb followed by a noun.
- The name **must not** contain prepositions (“for”, “with”, etc.).
- If word separation is required for the method name, `lowerCamelCase`
  **should** be used.

Examples:

- `getAccountBalance`
- `completeTransaction`

### Base URL in Action Package

The base URL configured in Action Package defines the common part of the actual
execution URL of the webhook.

- The base URL **may** include a trailing slash, but **must** work if
  `:customMethodName` is appended directly.
  - Google Cloud Functions base URLs without a trailing slash do not work,
    because the first segment of the path is used to identify the webhook.
- The endpoint **must** be HTTPS and **must** have a valid certificate.

Examples:

- `https://us-central1.cloudfunctions.net/myWebhook/` (**not**
  `https://us-central1.cloudfunctions.net/myWebhook`)
- `https://test.com/assistant/api`

### Actual execution URL

The vertical program **must** compute the actual execution URL by appending
`baseUrl` with `:customMethodName`.

Examples:

- `https://us-central1.cloudfunctions.net/myWebhook/:completeTransaction`
- `https://test.com/assistant/api:completeTransaction`
