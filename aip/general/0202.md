# Fields

The [`google.api.FieldInfo`][field info proto] type, through its accompanying
extension `google.api.field_info`, enriches a field's schema beyond the basic
name and type information.

## Guidance

Decorating a field with `google.api.field_info` is only necessary when
explicitly stated in this AIP or another that leverages `google.api.FieldInfo`
information. As such, the guidance herein applies to those scenarios as well.

### Format

Fields with a primitive type can still have a specific format. To convey that
type format, the `FieldInfo.Format` enumeration is used via the
`(google.api.field_info).format` extension field. The following guidance conveys
the meaning of and requirements for use of each `FieldInfo.Format` value.

#### UUID4

The `UUID4` format represents a UUID version 4 value as governed by
[RFC 4122][]. It **must** only be used on a field of type `string`.

Such a value **may** be normalized by the service to entirely lowercase letters.
For example, the value `F47AC10B-58CC-0372-8567-0E02B2C3D479` would be
normalized to `f47ac10b-58cc-0372-8567-0e02b2c3d479`.

As such, equivalence comparison **must not** be done via primitive text
comparison. Instead, an [RFC 4122][] compliant implementation **must** be used.

#### IPv4

The `IPV4` format represents an IP v4 address as governed by [RFC 791][]. It
**must** only be used on a field of type `string`.

Such a value **may** be condensed by the service, with leading zeros in each
octet stripped. For example, `001.022.233.040` would be condensed to
`1.22.233.40`.

As such, equivalence comparison **must not** be done via primitive text
comparison. Instead, an [RFC 791][] compliant implementation **must** be used.

#### IPv6

The `IPV6` format represents an IP v6 address as governed by [RFC 4291][]. It
**must** only be used on a field of type `string`.

Such a value **may** be normalized by the service to entirely lowercase letters
with zeros compressed, following [RFC 5952][]. For example, the value
`2001:0DB8:0::0` would be normalized to `2001:db8::`.

As such, equivalence comparison **must not** be done via primitive text
comparison. Instead, an [RFC 4291][] compliant implementation **must** be used.

#### IPv4 or IPv6

The `IPV4_OR_IPV6` value indicates that the field can be either an IP v4 or v6
address, as described in the [IPv4](#ipv4) and [IPv6](#ipv6) sections.

#### Format Compatibility

Adding a format specifier to an existing, unspecified field **is not** backwards
compatible, *unless* the field in question has always conformed to the format
being specified.

Changing an existing format specifier to a different one in all cases **is not**
backwards compatible.

#### Extending Format

Any new `FieldInfo.Format` value **must** be governed by an
[IETF-approved RFC][ietf rfc] or a [Google-approved AIP](./0001.md).

## Rationale

#### Why add a format specifier?

The format of a primitive-typed field can be critical to its usability. Some
programming languages may convey a specific type format as a standalone type,
as Java does with [UUID][java uuid]. Most have specific structural requirements
that are validated by the service, so conveying the format to the user ahead of
time is critical to their experience.

#### Why discourage primitive equality comparisons?

The text representations of the supported formats have many nuances and
transforming the value into a canonical representation is non-trivial. As such,
aligning implementations between each consumer and each service without any
issue is infeasiable.

#### Why document value normalizations?

While primitive comparison is not recommended for any of the supported formats,
uniform normalization of values is important to set consumer expectations, and
create a user-friendly surface.

#### Why require an RFC or AIP for new formats?

Those formats which are sufficiently standardized to merit an RFC or AIP are
stable enough and widely enough known to be incorporated as a supported value
and see usage in Google APIs. Requiring such extra guidance means that governing
the format specification is not the responsibility of the `FieldInfo.Format`
enumeration itself.
