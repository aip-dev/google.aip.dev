# AIP Versioning

This AIP defines the versioning scheme of the AIPs.

## Guidance

- The AIPs **must** be versioned by date, using the [ISO-8601 format of `YYYY-MM-DD`](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime), that corresponds to the date the version was added.
- AIPs versions **must** be available as a tag on the source control mechanism used to store the AIPs, of the format `v{version}`. Example: `v2023-03-28`.
- The AIPs **should** have a new version every 3 months, or when a significant change to an AIP occurs.

## Appendix

As the AIPs continue to evolve, it is beneficial for
the AIPs to have a way to denote older versions of the
specification to serve as a reference point for APIs
to explain the rationale of their design choices.

This becomes especially critical as AIPs can sometimes
reverse guidance, or include an updated design pattern
that may not look similar to the original pattern.

The rational for date-based versioning is:

- It allows for a simple heuristic to correlate the version of AIPs an API followed (look at the date of the API change, then look at the AIP version published right before that date).
- The daily granularity enables multiple changes to be published in a single month.
