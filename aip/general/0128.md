# Declarative-friendly interfaces

Many services need to interact with common DevOps tools, particularly those
that create and manage network-addressable resources (such as virtual machines,
load balancers, database instances, and so on). These tools revolve around the
principle of "configuration as code": the user specifies the complete intended
landscape, and tooling is responsible for making whatever changes are necessary
to achieve the user's specification.

These tools are **declarative**: rather than specifying specific _actions_ to
take, they specify the desired _outcome_, with the actions being derived based
on the differences between the current landscape and the intended one.

Furthermore, there are numerous popular DevOps tools, with more being
introduced each year. Integrating hundreds of resource types with multiple
tools requires uniformity, so that integration can be automated.

## Guidance

### Resources

Resources that are declarative-friendly **must** use only strongly-consistent
standard methods for managing resource lifecycle, which allows tools to support
these resources generically, as well as conforming to other
declarative-friendly guidance (see [further reading](#further-reading)).

Declarative-friendly resources **should** designate that they follow the
declarative-friendly style:

```proto
message Book {
  option (google.api.resource) = {
    type: "library.googleapis.com/Book"
    pattern: "publishers/{publisher}/books/{book}"
    style: DECLARATIVE_FRIENDLY
  };

  // Name and other fields...
}
```

### Reconciliation

If a resource takes time (more than a few seconds) for updates to be realized,
the resource **should** include a `bool reconciling` field to disclose that
changes are in flight. This field **must** be output only.

A resource **must** set the `reconciling` field to `true` if the current state
of the resource does not match the user's intended state, and the system is
working to reconcile them. This is regardless of whether the root cause of
going into reconciliation was user or system action.

**Note:** Services responding to a `GET` request **must** return the resource's
current state (not the intended state).

## Further reading

A significant amount of guidance is more strict for declarative-friendly
interfaces, due to the focus on automation on top of these resources. This list
is a comprehensive reference to declarative-friendly guidance in other AIPs:

- Resources **should not** employ custom methods: see AIP-136.
- Resources **must** use the `Update` method for repeated fields: see AIP-144.
- Resources **must** include certain standard fields: see AIP-148.
- Resources **must** have an `etag` field: see AIP-154.
- Resources **should** provide change validation: see AIP-163.
- Resources **should not** implement soft-delete. If the id cannot be re-used,
  the resource **must** implement soft-delete and the undelete RPC: see AIP-164


### Annotations

See [AIP-148 annotations][].

## Changelog

- **2023-07-13**: Move `annotations` from AIP-148.
- **2023-06-17**: Definition of plane was removed and incorporated into AIP-111.
- **2023-05-11**: Removed must on resource_id, which was upstreamed to a general
  must.
