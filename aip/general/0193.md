# Errors

Effective error communication is an important part of designing simple and
intuitive APIs. Services returning standardized error responses enable API
clients to construct centralized common error handling logic. This common logic
simplifies API client applications and eliminates the need for cumbersome
custom error handling code.

## Guidance

Services **must** return a [`google.rpc.Status`][Status] message when an API
error occurs, and **must** use the canonical error codes defined in
[`google.rpc.Code`][Code]. More information about the particular codes is
available in the [gRPC status code documentation][].

Error messages **should** help a reasonably technical user _understand_ and
_resolve_ the issue, and **should not** assume that the user is an expert in
your particular API. Additionally, error messages **must not** assume that the
user will know anything about its underlying implementation.

Error messages **should** be brief but actionable. Any extra information
**should** be provided in the `details` field. If even more information is
necessary, you **should** provide a link where a reader can get more
information or ask questions to help resolve the issue.

### Details

Google defines a set of [standard detail payloads][details] for error details,
which cover most common needs for API errors. Services **should** use these
standard details payloads when feasible.

Structured details with machine-readable identifiers **must** be used if users
will need to write code against a specific aspect of the error. Error message
strings **may** change over time; however, if an error message does not have a
machine-readable identifier _in addition to_ the `code` field, changing the
error message **must** be considered a backwards-incompatible change.

**Note:** The [`ErrorInfo`][ErrorInfo] message is the recommended way to send a
machine-readable identifier.

#### Uniqueness

Each type of detail payload **must** be included only once. For example,
there **must not** not be more than one `ErrorInfo` message in the
`details` field, but there **may** be an `ErrorInfo` and a
[`PreconditionFailure`][PreconditionFailure].

### Localization

Error messages **must** be in English. If a localized error message is also
required, the service **should** use [`google.rpc.LocalizedMessage`][details]
in the `details` field.

### Partial errors

APIs **should not** support partial errors. Partial errors add significant
complexity for users, because they usually sidestep the use of error codes, or
move those error codes into the response message, where the user must write
specialized error handling logic to address the problem.

However, occasionally partial errors are necessary, particularly in bulk
operations where it would be hostile to users to fail an entire large request
because of a problem with a single entry.

Methods that require partial errors **should** use [long-running operations][],
and the method **should** put partial failure information in the metadata
message. The errors themselves **must** still be represented with a
[`google.rpc.Status`][Status] object.

### Permission Denied

If the user does not have permission to access the resource or parent,
regardless of whether or not it exists, the service **must** error with
`PERMISSION_DENIED` (HTTP 403). Permission **must** be checked prior to checking
if the resource or parent exists.

If the user does have proper permission, but the requested resource or parent
does not exist, the service **must** error with `NOT_FOUND` (HTTP 404).

## Changelog

- **2023-05-04**: Require uniqueness by message type for error details.
- **2022-11-04**: Added guidance around PERMISSION_DENIED errors previously
  found in other AIPs.
- **2022-08-12**: Reworded/Simplified intro to add clarity to the intent.
- **2020-01-22**: Added a reference to the [`ErrorInfo`][ErrorInfo] message.
- **2019-10-14**: Added guidance restricting error message mutability to if
  there is a machine-readable identifier present.
- **2019-09-23**: Added guidance about error message strings being able to
  change.
