# Errors

Effective error communication is an important part of designing simple and intuitive APIs. Services returning standardized error responses enable API clients to construct centralized common error handling logic. This common logic simplifies API client applications and eliminates the need for cumbersome custom error handling code.

## Guidance

Services **must** return a <code>[google.rpc.Status](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/rpc/status.proto)</code> message when an API error occurs, and <strong>must</strong> use the canonical error codes defined in <code>[google.rpc.Code](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/rpc/code.proto)</code>. More information about the particular codes is available in the [gRPC status code documentation](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/statuscodes.md).

Error messages **should** help a reasonably technical user _understand_ and _resolve_ the issue, and **should not** assume that the user is an expert in your particular API. Additionally, error messages **must not** assume that the user will know anything about its underlying implementation.

Error messages **should** be brief but actionable. Any extra information **should** be provided in the `details `field. If even more information is necessary, you **should** provide a link where a reader can get more information or ask questions to help resolve the issue.  It is also important to [set the right tone](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/error-messages/set-tone) when writing messages. 

### Error Response

#### JSON representation

A JSON representation of an error response might look like the following example.

For the purposes of following best practices, it’s helpful to break the error response into sections. Note that the order in which you write the error message is often different from how the error is presented to users.

```
<<<<<<GoogleRPC.status>>>>>>
{
  "error": {
    "code": 429,
    "message": "The zone 'us-east1-a' does not have enough resources available to fulfill the request. Try a different zone, or try again later.", <<<Developer-facing problem description
    "status": "RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED",
    "details": [
<<<<<<ErrorDetails>>>>>>
<<<<<<ErrorInfo payload>>>>>>
      {
        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.rpc.ErrorInfo",
        "reason": "RESOURCE_AVAILABILITY",  <<< ErrorInfo reason
        "domain": "compute.googleapis.com",
        "metadata": {
          "zone": "us-east1-a",
          "vmType": "e2-medium",
          "attachment": "local-ssd=3,nvidia-t4=2",
          "zonesWithCapacity": "us-central1-f,us-central1-c"
        }
      },
<<<<<<LocalizedMessage payload>>>>>>
      {
        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.rpc.LocalizedMessage",
        "locale": "en-US",
        "message": "An <e2-medium> VM instance with <local-ssd=3,nvidia-t4=2> is currently unavailable in the <us-east1-a> zone.
                    Consider trying your request in the <us-central1-f,us-central1-c> zone(s), which currently has/have capacity
                    to accommodate your request.
                    Alternatively, you can try your request again with a different VM hardware configuration or at a later time.
                    For more information, see the troubleshooting documentation."<<<User-facing message
      },
<<<<<<HelpLink payload>>>>>>
      {
        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.rpc.Help",
        "links": [
          {
            "description": "Additional information on this error",
            "url": "https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/resource-error"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### google.rpc.Status

Services must return a [google.rpc.Status](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/rpc/status.proto) message when an API error occurs. For each error, the service **must** populate the `message` string in <code>[google.rpc.Status](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/rpc/status.proto)</code> as follows:

*   present a developer-facing, human-readable "debug message"
*   present the message in the service's native language
*   explain both the error and offer an actionable resolution to it ([citation](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors#error_model))

**Note:** Sometimes a service will elect to always present `Status.message` in English rather than the application's native language so that messages are easily searchable in common knowledge bases, such as StackOverflow™.

Details of this object are summarized in the table that follows.

Important points:

*   This `message` string is considered a problem description. It is intended for human developers to understand the problem and is more detailed than <code>[ErrorInfo.reason](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/rpc/error_details.proto#L57)</code>, discussed in the next section.
*   Use simple descriptive language that is easy to understand (without technical jargon) to clearly state the problem that results in an error.
*   For pre-existing (brownfield) APIs, the information in <code>google.rpc.Status</code> already exists and can’t be changed. In this case, do not edit anything in this <code>google.rpc.Status</code>, because some users might have automation running against the pre-existing content. For example, any changes in text for the <code>message</code> string could cause breakages. For more information, see [Changing Error Messages](#changing-error-messages).

#### [ErrorDetails](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/rpc/error_details.proto)

Google defines a set of [standard detail payloads](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/rpc/error_details.proto) for error details, which cover most common needs for API errors. Services **should** use these standard detail payloads when feasible.  

Structured details with machine-readable identifiers **must** be used if users will need to write code against a specific aspect of the error. Error message strings **may** change over time; however, if an error message does not have a machine-readable identifier _in addition to_ the `code` string, changing the error message **must** be considered a backwards-incompatible change.

For the purpose of this discussion, the ErrorDetails section contains three payloads: `ErrorInfo`, `LocalizedMessage`, and `HelpLink`.

##### Uniqueness

Each type of detail payload **must** be included at most once. For example, there **must not** be more than one <code>[BadRequest](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/477a59d764428136ba1d857a9633c0d231de6efa/google/rpc/error_details.proto#L168-L218)</code> message in the <code>details</code>, but there <strong>may</strong> be a <code>BadRequest</code> and a <code>[PreconditionFailure](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/6f3fcc058ff29989f6d3a71557a44b5e81b897bd/google/rpc/error_details.proto#L139-L166)</code>.

##### ErrorInfo payload

The <code>[ErrorInfo](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/6f3fcc058ff29989f6d3a71557a44b5e81b897bd/google/rpc/error_details.proto#L27-L76)</code> message is the required way to send a machine-readable identifier. All error responses <strong>must</strong> include an <code>ErrorInfo</code> payload in <code>details</code>. Variable information <strong>should</strong> be included in <code>metadata</code> in <code>ErrorInfo</code> and <strong>must</strong> be included if it appears within an error message.

When introducing an error that represents a failure scenario that did not previously occur for the service, the payload **must** include `ErrorInfo` and any variables found in dynamic segments of the error message **must** be present in `ErrorInfo.metadata` (See [Dynamic variables](#dynamic-variables).

**Note:** `ErrorInfo` represents a special case. There **must** be exactly one `ErrorInfo`. It is required.

|                                       | Variables](#dynamic-variables).       |
+---------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+


##### Dynamic variables

The best, actionable error messages include dynamic segments. These variable parts of the message are specific to a particular request.  Without such context, it is unlikely that the message will be fully actionable by the user. 

This practice is critical so that machine actors do not need to rely on `LocalizedMessage.message`, which is subject to change and is not part of the API contract. 

Consider the following example:

```
    The Book, "The Great Gatsby", is unavailable at the Library, "Garfield East".
    It is expected to be available again on 2199-05-13.
```

The preceding error message is made actionable by the context, both originating from the request, the title of the Book,  the name of the Library, and by the information that is known only by the service, that is,  the expected return date of the Book.

All dynamic variables found in error messages **must** also be present in the `map<string, string>`, `ErrorInfo.metadata` (found on the _required_ `ErrorInfo`). For example, the `metadata` map for the sample error message above will include _at least_ the following key/value pairs:

```
bookTitle: "The Great Gatsby"
library: "Garfield East"
expectedReturnDate: "2199-05-13"
```

The following example shows an additional example of a metadata map for information about virtual machines: 

```
vmType: "<VM-TYPE>",
attachment: "<ATTACHMENT>"
zone: "<ZONE>"
```

Dynamic variables that do not appear in an error message **may** also be included in `metadata` to provide additional information to the client to be used programmatically.

Once present in `metadata`, keys **must** continue to be included in the map for the error payload to be backwards compatible, even if the value for a particular key is empty. Keys **must** be expressed as lower camel-case.

##### Localization

If a localized error message is required, the service **must** include <code>[google.rpc.LocalizedMessage](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/e9897ed945336e2dc967b439ac7b4be6d2c62640/google/rpc/error_details.proto#L275-L285)</code> in <code>Status.details</code>. The value of the <code>Status.message string</code> <strong>should</strong> be presented in the service's native language in the <code>LocalizedMessage.message</code> string, while also ensuring that the<code> locale</code> string shows the correct language.

##### LocalizedMessage payload

The LocalizedMessage payload **should** contain the complete resolution to the error.  If more information is needed than can fit in this payload, then additional resolution information **must** be provided in the HelpLink payload. See the [HelpLink payload](#helplink-payload) section for guidance.

For pre-existing (brownfield) APIs, the content in this `message` string will differ from the `message` string in `google.rpc.status`.

##### HelpLink payload

When `LocalizedMessage.message` doesn’t provide the user sufficient context or actionable next steps, or if there are multiple points of failure that need to be considered in troubleshooting, a link to supplemental troubleshooting documentation **must** be provided in the `HelpLink `payload.

Provide this information in addition to a clear problem definition and actionable resolution, not as an alternative to them; for example.

### Error messages

The following sections describe best practices for error messages not described previously.

#### Changing error messages

##### Method

The method of changing error messages depends on whether an ErrorInfo payload is present in the message.

If the error message contains ErrorInfo payload (a machine-readable identifier):

*   `Status.message` _string_ and `LocalizedMessage.message` _string_ can change
*   New metadata fields can be added
*   However, existing metadata fields **must not** be removed and existing metadata field keys cannot be modified.

If the error message does _not_ contain ErrorInfo payload (usually for pre-existing APIs):

*   The `LocalizedMessage.message` _string_ can change
*   However, the `Status.message` _string_ **must** not be changed, as this change is backward-incompatible.

##### Message alignment

By default, `LocalizedMessage` is populated with the same message as `Status.message`. Should you choose, you can also present a different `LocalizedMessage.message` from `Status.message`. The following are some reasons why.

Keeping the aforementioned guidance in mind, the safest and recommended method to update an error message for a service is to add <code>[google.rpc.LocalizedMessage](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/e9897ed945336e2dc967b439ac7b4be6d2c62640/google/rpc/error_details.proto#L275-L285)</code> to <code>[Status.details](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/aeae5ea2b01ece6c0cee046ae84b881cdc62b95d/google/rpc/status.proto#L46-L48)</code>. <code>LocalizedMessage</code> is meant for displaying messages to end users. 

The error message presented in `LocalizedMessage.message` **should** be the same as `Status.message` or it **should** be an alternate message. Add as much information as the consumer of the error needs to resolve the error, but succinctly.

Reasons to present the same error message in both locations include the following:

*   The service plans to localize either immediately or in the near future. See, "[Localization](https://google.aip.dev/193#localization)".
*   This practice enables clients to find an error message consistently in one location, `LocalizedMessaage.message`, across all methods of the API Service.

Reasons to present an error message in `LocalizedMessage.message` that differs from `Status.message` include the following:

*   The service requires an end-user-facing error message that differs from the "debug message".
*   Ongoing, iterative error message improvements are expected.

When including `LocalizedMessage`, both `locale` and `message` **must** be populated. If the service is to be localized, the value of `locale` **must** change dynamically. See [Localization](https://google.aip.dev/193#localization). Otherwise, `locale` **must** always present the service's default locale; for example, "en-US".

When adding an error message using `LocalizedMessage`, `ErrorInfo` **must** be introduced either before or at the same time. If there are dynamic segments found in the text, the values of these variables **must** be included in `ErrorInfo.metadata`. See, "[Dynamic variables](#dynamic-variables)".

**Warning:** If `LocalizedMessage` is released without `ErrorInfo`, the same [concerns](#status-message-warning) regarding client misuse of textual error messages apply.

#### Message Layout

Actionable error messages are consumed by human actors, often brokered by a specific surface. For these messages to be maximally useful and actionable, an effective layout is imperative.

The following layout guidelines make error messages easy to read or scan. 

The presentation depends on the product surface, so these guidelines explain best practices for a standard layout across common product surfaces such as gcloud, Pantheon, or Terraform.

*   Place the Error description in the first line (required)
*   List each instance of metadata in a new line, indented
*   Place the Resolution in a newline after a line space
*   Include a hyperlink for documentation as part of the description

The following example shows an actionable error message for the gcloud command line according to these guidelines.

```
ERROR: 429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED

An n2d-standard-224 VM instance with 24 local SSD(s) is currently
unavailable in the us-central-1a zone.

"vm-type": "n2d-standard-224"
"attachment": "24 local SSD(s)"
"zone": "us-central-1a",

Consider trying your request in the us-central1-f, us-central1-c
zone(s), which currently has/have capacity to accommodate your request.

Alternatively, you can try your request again with a different VM
hardware configuration or at a later time. For more information, see
the troubleshooting documentation:
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/resource-error
```

### Partial errors

APIs **should not** support partial errors. Partial errors add significant complexity for users, because they usually sidestep the use of error codes, or move those error codes into the response message, where the user **must** write specialized error handling logic to address the problem.

However, occasionally partial errors are necessary, particularly in bulk operations where it would be hostile to users to fail an entire large request because of a problem with a single entry.

Methods that require partial errors **should** use [long-running operations](https://google.aip.dev/151), and the method **should** put partial failure information in the metadata message. The errors themselves **must** still be represented with a <code>[google.rpc.Status](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/rpc/status.proto)</code> object.

### Permission Denied

If the user does not have permission to access the resource or parent, regardless of whether or not it exists, the service **must** error with `PERMISSION_DENIED` (HTTP 403). Permission **must** be checked prior to checking if the resource or parent exists.

If the user does have proper permission, but the requested resource or parent does not exist, the service **must** error with `NOT_FOUND` (HTTP 404).

## Rationale

### Requiring ErrorInfo

`ErrorInfo` is required because it further identifies an error. With only approximately twenty [available values](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/rpc/code.proto) for `Status.status`, it is difficult to disambiguate one error from another across an entire [API Service](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/glossary#api_service).

Also, error messages often contain dynamic segments that express variable information, so there needs to be machine-readable component of _every_ error response that enables clients to use such information programmatically.

### LocalizedMessage

`LocalizedMessage` was selected as the location to present alternate error messages. This is desirable when clients need to display a crafted error message directly to end users. `LocalizedMessage` can be used with a static `locale`. This may seem misleading, but it allows the service to eventually localize without having to duplicate or move the error message, which would be a backwards incompatible change.

### Updating Status.Message

**Because Status.Message is part of the API contract**, avoid updating it entirely in favor of updating LocalizedMessage; for example, clients often perform string matches on the text to differentiate one error for another and even parse the error message to extract variables from dynamic segments.
