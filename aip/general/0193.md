# Errors

Effective error communication is an important part of designing simple and
intuitive APIs. Services returning standardized error responses enable API
clients to construct centralized common error handling logic. This common logic
simplifies API client applications and eliminates the need for cumbersome
custom error handling code.

## Guidance

Services **must** return a [`google.rpc.Status`][Status] message when an API
error occurs, and **must** use the canonical error codes defined in
[`google.rpc.Code`][Code]. More information about the particular codes is
available in the [gRPC status code documentation][].

Error messages **should** help a reasonably technical user _understand_ and
_resolve_ the issue, and **should not** assume that the user is an expert in
your particular API. Additionally, error messages **must not** assume that the
user will know anything about its underlying implementation.

Error messages **should** be brief but actionable. Any extra information
**should** be provided in the `details` field. If even more information is
necessary, you **should** provide a link where a reader can get more
information or ask questions to help resolve the issue.

### Details

Google defines a set of [standard detail payloads][details] for error details,
which cover most common needs for API errors. Services **should** use these
standard details payloads when feasible.

Structured details with machine-readable identifiers **must** be used if users
will need to write code against a specific aspect of the error. Error message
strings **may** change over time; however, if an error message does not have a
machine-readable identifier _in addition to_ the `code` field, changing the
error message **must** be considered a backwards-incompatible change.

#### ErrorInfo

The [`ErrorInfo`][ErrorInfo] message is the required way to send a
machine-readable identifier. All error responses **must** include an
`ErrorInfo` payload in the `details` field. Variable information
**should** be included in the `metadata` field on `ErrorInfo` and
**must** be included if it appears within an error message.

#### Uniqueness

Each type of detail payload **must** be included at most once. For
example, there **must not** be more than one [`BadRequest`][BadRequest]
message in the `details` field, but there **may** be a `BadRequest` and
a [`PreconditionFailure`][PreconditionFailure].

**Note:** `ErrorInfo` represents a special case. There **must** be exactly one
`ErrorInfo`. It is required.

### Error messages

The [`google.rpc.Status`][Status] error payload houses error messages in
two places. There is the field, `message`, at the root of the payload,
and there also is another `message` field on
[`google.rpc.LocalizedMessage`][LocalizedMessage]. `Status` **must**
always have a value for `message`. It should,

- Be developer-facing, human-readable, and in English
- Both expalin the error and offer an actionable resolution to it
  ([citation](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors#error_model))

Once launched the value of `message` found at the root-level of `Status`
**must not** change for the error response to be backwards compatible.

Each error response, **should** include `LocalizedMessage`. Both the
`locale` and `message` fields **must** be populated.  `LocalizedMessage`
**must** be included to change existing error messages such that the
change is backwards compatible, in most cases.

#### Changing error messages

Because the error message at the root of the payload **must not** change
after it is launched, a new, additional error message **may** be added.
The purpose of this change might be to add a message that a client
application could display directly to end users. To do so, include
[`LocalizedMessage`][LocalizedMessage] in the payload to enable the
error payload to include a second, improved message.

The field, `locale`, **must** be populated but **may** always contain
the value of the service's default locale, e.g.  "en-US". While this
means that the this additional error messages is not, in fact,
localized, it provides the service owner with the opportunity to do so
later.  Alternatively, the value of `locale` **may** change if the
service is location aware. See, "[Localization](#localization)".

When adding a new error messsage using `LocalizedMessage`, `ErrorInfo`
**must** be introduced either before or at the same time. If there are
dyanmic variables found in the message, the `ErrorInfo` field,
`metadata`, **must** include all of these variables. (See, "[Dynamic
variables](#dynamic-variables".)

**Warning:** If `LocalizedMessage` is released without `ErrorInfo` and
with an error message that includes dynamic segments, the error message
**must not** be changed. To do so, would be backwards incompatible,
effectively locking all error messages in the payload.

#### Dynamic variables

The best, actionable error messages include dynamic segments. These
variable parts of the message are specific to a particular request.
Consider the following example:

> The Book, "The Great Gatsby", is unvailable at the Library, "Garfield
> East". It is expected to be available again on 2199-05-13.

**Note:** The preceeding error message is made actionable by the
context, both that orignates from the request, the title of the Book and
the name of the Library, and by the information that is  known only by
the service, i.e. the expected return date of the Book.

All dynamic variables found in error messages **must** also appear in
the `map<string, string>` field, `metadata`, found on the *required*
error details payload, `ErrorInfo`.  For example, the `metadata` map for
the sample error message above **must** include *at least* the following
key/value pairs:

```yaml
bookTitle: "The Great Gatsby"
library: "Garfield East"
expectedReturnDate: "2199-05-13"
```

Dynamic variables that do not appear in an error message **may** also be
included in `metadata` to provide additional information to the client
to be used programmatically.

Once present in `metadata`, keys **must** continue to be included in the
map for the error response to be backwards compatible.

#### Localization

The error message, found in the payload on `Status`, **must** be in
English. If a localized error message is also required, the service
**should** use [`google.rpc.LocalizedMessage`][LocalizedMessage] in the
`details` field.

### Partial errors

APIs **should not** support partial errors. Partial errors add significant
complexity for users, because they usually sidestep the use of error codes, or
move those error codes into the response message, where the user must write
specialized error handling logic to address the problem.

However, occasionally partial errors are necessary, particularly in bulk
operations where it would be hostile to users to fail an entire large request
because of a problem with a single entry.

Methods that require partial errors **should** use [long-running operations][],
and the method **should** put partial failure information in the metadata
message. The errors themselves **must** still be represented with a
[`google.rpc.Status`][Status] object.

### Permission Denied

If the user does not have permission to access the resource or parent,
regardless of whether or not it exists, the service **must** error with
`PERMISSION_DENIED` (HTTP 403). Permission **must** be checked prior to checking
if the resource or parent exists.

If the user does have proper permission, but the requested resource or parent
does not exist, the service **must** error with `NOT_FOUND` (HTTP 404).

## Rationale

`ErrorInfo` is required because it further identifies an error. The
`Status` field, with under 20 [allowed values][Code], is rarely enough
to disambiguate one error from another accross an entire API Service.
Error messages often contain dynamic segments that express values, such
as project numbers or locations, and these values are often read from
the string message using brittle extraction methods, like RegExp. There
needs to be a machine readable component of *every* error response that
enables clients to pull such information programatically--without
parsing the string error message. For these reasons, `ErrorInfo` is
required for *every* error response.

The field, `message`, on `Status` is immutable because client **may**
rely upon it to disambiguate errors. For example, client software may
leverage a string contains or regexp match on the string error message
itself to determine the difference of one error with `status`,
`PRECONDTION_FAILURE`, from another.

`LocalizedMessage` serves two purposes, to allow for error message
improvements and for true localization.  Regardless of the reaon for
adding it, doing so allows for localization to be introduced at any
time.
