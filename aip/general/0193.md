# Errors

Effective error communication is an important part of designing simple
and intuitive APIs. Services returning standardized error responses
enable API clients to construct centralized common error handling logic.
This common logic simplifies API client applications and eliminates the
need for cumbersome custom error handling code.

## Guidance

Services **must** return a [`google.rpc.Status`][Status] message when an
API error occurs, and **must** use the canonical error codes defined in
[`google.rpc.Code`][Code].  More information about the particular codes
is available in the [gRPC status code documentation][].

Error messages **should** help a reasonably technical user *understand*
and *resolve* the issue, and **should not** assume that the user is an
expert in your particular API. Additionally, error messages **must not**
assume that the user will know anything about its underlying
implementation.

Error messages **should** be brief but actionable. Any extra information
**should** be provided in the `details` field. If even more information
is necessary, you **should** provide a link where a reader can get more
information or ask questions to help resolve the issue. It is also
important to [set the right tone][writing-tone] when writing messages.

The following sections describe the fields of `google.rpc.Status`.

### Status.message

The `message` field is a developer-facing, human-readable "debug message"
which **should** be in English. (Localized messages are expressed using
a `LocalizedMessage` within the `details` field. See
[`LocalizedMessage`](#localizedmessage) for more details.) Any dynamic aspects of
the message **must** be included as metadata within the `ErrorInfo` that appears
in [`details`](#status-details).

The message is considered a problem description. It is intended for
developers to understand the problem and is more detailed than
[`ErrorInfo.reason`][ErrorInfo-reason], discussed [later](#errorinfo).

Messages **should** use simple descriptive language that is easy to understand
(without technical jargon) to clearly state the problem that results in an
error, and offer an actionable resolution to it.

For pre-existing (brownfield) APIs which have previously returned errors
without machine-readable identifiers, the value of `message` **must**
remain the same for any given error. For more information, see
[Changing Error Messages](#changing-error-messages).

### Status.code

The `code` field is the status code, which **must** be the numeric value of
one of the elements of the [`google.rpc.Code`][Code] enum.

For example, the value `5` is the numeric value of the `NOT_FOUND`
enum element.

### Status.details

The `details` field allows messages with additional error information to
be included in the error response, each packed in a `google.protobuf.Any`
message.

Google defines a set of [standard detail payloads][details] for error
details, which cover most common needs for API errors. 
Services **should** use these standard detail payloads when feasible.

Each type of detail payload **must** be included at most once. For
example, there **must not** be more than one [`BadRequest`][BadRequest]
message in the `details`, but there **may** be a `BadRequest` and a
[`PreconditionFailure`][PreconditionFailure].

All error responses **must** include an `ErrorInfo` within `details`. This
provides machine-readable identifiers so that users can write code against
specific aspects of the error.

The following sections describe the most common standard detail payloads.

#### ErrorInfo

The [`ErrorInfo`][ErrorInfo] message is the primary way to send a
machine-readable identifier. Contextual information **should** be
included in `metadata` in `ErrorInfo` and **must** be included if it
appears within an error message.

The `reason` field is a short snake_case description of the cause of the
error. Error reasons are unique within a particular domain of errors.
The reason **must** be at most 63 characters and match a regular expression of
`[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]+[A-Z0-9]`. (This is UPPER_SNAKE_CASE, without leading
or trailing underscores, and without leading digits.)

The reason **should** be terse, but meaningful enough for a human reader to
understand what the reason refers to.

Good examples:

- `CPU_AVAILABILITY`
- `NO_STOCK`
- `CHECKED_OUT`
- `AVAILABILITY_ERROR`

Bad examples:

- `THE_BOOK_YOU_WANT_IS_NOT_AVAILABLE` (overly verbose)
- `ERROR` (too general)

The `domain` field is the logical grouping to which the `reason` belongs.
The domain **must** be a globally unique value, and is typically the name of the service
that generated the error, e.g. `pubsub.googleapis.com`.

The (reason, domain) pair form a machine-readable way of identifying a particular error.
Services **must** use the same (reason, domain) pair for the same error, and
**must not** use the same (reason, domain) pair for logically different errors.
The decision about whether two errors are "the same" or not is not always clear, but
**should** generally be considered in terms of the expected action a client might take
to resolve them.

The `metadata` field is a map of key/value pairs providing additional
dynamic information as context. Each key within `metadata` **must** be at most
64 characters long, and conform to the regular expression `[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9-_]+`.

Any request-specific information which contributes to the `Status.message` or
`LocalizedMessage.message` messages **must** be represented within `metadata`.
This practice is critical so that machine actors do not need to parse error
messages to extract information.

For example consider the following message:

> An &lt;e2-medium&gt; VM instance with &lt;local-ssd=3,nvidia-t4=2&gt; is currently unavailable
> in the &lt;us-east1-a&gt; zone. Consider trying your request in the &lt;us-central1-f,us-central1-c&gt;
> zone(s), which currently has/have capacity to accommodate your request. Alternatively,
> you can try your request again with a different VM hardware configuration
> or at a later time. For more information, see the troubleshooting documentation.

The `ErrorInfo.metadata` map for the same error could be:

- `"zone": "us-east1-a"`
- `"vmType": "e2-medium"`
- `"attachment": "local-ssd=3,nvidia-t4=2"`
- `"zonesWithCapacity": "us-central1-f,us-central1-c"`

Additional contextual information that does not appear in an error message
**may** also be included in `metadata` to allow programmatic use by the client.

The metadata included for any given (reason,domain) pair can evolve over time:

- New keys **may** be included
- All keys that have been included **must** continue to be included (but may have empty values)

In other words, once a user has observed a given key for a (reason, domain) pair, the
service **must** allow them to rely on it continuing to be present in the future.

The set of keys provided in each (reason, domain) pair is independent from other pairs,
but services **should** aim for consistent key naming. For example, two error reasons
within the same domain should not use metadata keys of `vmType` and `virtualMachineType`.

#### LocalizedMessage

[`google.rpc.LocalizedMessage`][LocalizedMessage] is used to provide an error
message which **should** be localized to a user-specified locale where
possible.

If the [`Status.message`](#status-message) field has a sub-optimal value
which cannot be changed due to the constraints in the
[Changing Error Messages](#changing-error-messages) section, `LocalizedMessage`
**may** be used to provide a better error message even when no user-specified
locale is available.

Regardless of how the locale for the message was determined, both the `locale`
and `message` fields **must** be populated.

The `locale` field specifies the locale of the message,
following [IETF bcp47](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt) (Tags for
Identifying Languages). Example values: `"en-US"`, `"fr-CH"`, `"es-MX"`.

The `message` field contains the localized text itself. This
**should** include a brief description of the error and a call to action
to resolve the error. The message **should** include contextual information
to make the message as specific as possible. Any contextual information
in the message **must** be included in `ErrorInfo.metadata`. See
[`ErrorInfo`](#errorinfo) for more details of how contextual information
may be included in a message and the corresponding metadata.

The `LocalizedMessage` payload **should** contain the complete resolution
to the error. If more information is needed than can reasonably fit in this
payload, then additional resolution information **must** be provided in
a `Help` payload.  See the [Help](#help) section for guidance.

#### Help

When other textual error messages (in `Status.message` or
`LocalizedMessage.message`) don't provide the user sufficient
context or actionable next steps, or if there are multiple points of
failure that need to be considered in troubleshooting, a link to
supplemental troubleshooting documentation **must** be provided in the
`Help` payload.

Provide this information in addition to a clear problem definition and
actionable resolution, not as an alternative to them. The linked
documentation **must** clearly relate to the error. If a single page
contains information about multiple errors, the
[`ErrorInfo.reason`](#errorinfo) value **must** be used to narrow down
the relevant information.

The `description` field is a textual description of the linked information.
This **must** be suitable to display to a user as text for a hyperlink.
This **must** be plain text (not HTML, Markdown etc).

Example `description` value: `"Troubleshooting documentation for STOCKOUT errors"`

The `url` field is the URL to link to. This **must** be an absolute URL,
including scheme.

Example `url` value:
`"https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/resource-error"`

For publicly-documented services, even those with access controls on actual
usage, the linked content **must** be accessible without authentication.

For privately-documented services, the linked content **may** require
authentication.

### Error messages

Textual error messages can be present in both `Status.message` and
`LocalizedMessage.message` fields. Messages **should** be succinct but
actionable, with request-specific information (such as a resource name
or region) providing precise details where appropriate. Any request-specific
details **must** be present in [`ErrorInfo.metadata`](#errorinfo).

#### Changing error messages

Changing the content of `Status.message` over time must be done carefully,
to avoid breaking clients who have previously had to rely on the message
for all information. See [the rationale section](#updating-statusmessage)
for more details.

For a given RPC:

- If the RPC has *always* returned `ErrorInfo` with machine-readable
  information, the content of `Status.message` **may** change over time.
  (For example, the API producer may provide a clearer explanation,
  or more request-specific information.)
- Otherwise, the content of `Status.message` **must** be stable,
  providing the same text with the same request-specific information.
  Instead of changing `Status.message`, the API **should** include a
  [`LocalizedMessage`](#localizedmessage) within `Status.details`.


Even if an RPC has always returned `ErrorInfo`, the API **may** keep
the existing `Status.message` stable and add a
[`LocalizedMessage`](#localizedmessage) within `Status.details`.

The content of `LocalizedMessage.details` **may** change over time.

### Partial errors

APIs **should not** support partial errors. Partial errors add
significant complexity for users, because they usually sidestep the use
of error codes, or move those error codes into the response message,
where the user **must** write specialized error handling logic to
address the problem.

However, occasionally partial errors are necessary, particularly in bulk
operations where it would be hostile to users to fail an entire large
request because of a problem with a single entry.

Methods that require partial errors **should** use [long-running
operations][], and the method **should** put partial failure information
in the metadata message. The errors themselves **must** still be
represented with a [`google.rpc.Status`][Status] object.

### Permission Denied

If the user does not have permission to access the resource or parent,
regardless of whether or not it exists, the service **must** error with
`PERMISSION_DENIED` (HTTP 403). Permission **must** be checked prior to
checking if the resource or parent exists.

If the user does have proper permission, but the requested resource or
parent does not exist, the service **must** error with `NOT_FOUND` (HTTP
404).

## HTTP/1.1+JSON representation

When clients use HTTP/1.1 as per [AIP-127](./0127.md), the error information
is returned in the body of the response, as a JSON object. For backward
compatibility reasons, this does not map precisely to `google.rpc.Status`,
but contains the same core information. The schema is defined in the following proto:

```proto
message Error {
  message Status {
    // The HTTP status code that corresponds to `google.rpc.Status.code`.
    int32 code = 1;
    // This corresponds to `google.rpc.Status.message`.
    string message = 2;
    // This is the enum version for `google.rpc.Status.code`.
    google.rpc.Code status = 4;
    // This corresponds to `google.rpc.Status.details`.
    repeated google.protobuf.Any details = 5;
  }

  Status error = 1;
}
```

The most important difference is that the `code` field in the JSON is an HTTP status code,
*not* the direct value of `google.rpc.Status.code`. For example, a `google.rpc.Status`
message with a `code` value of 5 would be mapped to an object including the following
code-related fields (as well as the message, details etc):

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 404,          // The HTTP status code for "not found"
    "status": "NOT_FOUND" // The name in google.rpc.Code for value 5
  }
}
```

The following JSON shows a fully populated HTTP/1.1+JSON representation of an error response.


```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 429,
    "message": "The zone 'us-east1-a' does not have enough resources available to fulfill the request. Try a different zone, or try again later.",
    "status": "RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED",
    "details": [
      {
        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.rpc.ErrorInfo",
        "reason": "RESOURCE_AVAILABILITY",
        "domain": "compute.googleapis.com",
        "metadata": {
          "zone": "us-east1-a",
          "vmType": "e2-medium",
          "attachment": "local-ssd=3,nvidia-t4=2",
          "zonesWithCapacity": "us-central1-f,us-central1-c"
        }
      },
      {
        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.rpc.LocalizedMessage",
        "locale": "en-US",
        "message": "An <e2-medium> VM instance with <local-ssd=3,nvidia-t4=2> is currently unavailable in the <us-east1-a> zone. Consider trying your request in the <us-central1-f,us-central1-c> zone(s), which currently has/have capacity to accommodate your request. Alternatively, you can try your request again with a different VM hardware configuration or at a later time. For more information, see the troubleshooting documentation."
      },
      {
        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.rpc.Help",
        "links": [
          {
            "description": "Additional information on this error",
            "url": "https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/resource-error"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```


## Rationale

### Requiring ErrorInfo

`ErrorInfo` is required because it further identifies an error. With
only approximately twenty [available values][Code] for `Status.status`,
it is difficult to disambiguate one error from another across an entire
[API Service][API Service].

Also, error messages often contain dynamic segments that express
variable information, so there needs to be machine-readable component of
*every* error response that enables clients to use such information
programmatically.

### Including LocalizedMessage

`LocalizedMessage` was selected as the location to present alternate
error messages. While `LocalizedMessage` **may** use a locale specified
in the request, a service **may** provide a `LocalizedMessage` even without
a user-specified locale, typically to provide a better error message in
[situations where `Status.message` cannot be changed](#updating-statusmessage).
Where the locale is not specified by the user, it **should** be `en-US`
(US English).

A service **may** include `LocalizedMessage` even when the same message is
provided in `Status.message` and when localization into a user-specified locale
is not supported. Reasons for this include:

- An intention to support user-specified localization in the near future, allowing
  clients to consistently use `LocalizedMessage` and not change their error-reporting
  code when the functionality is introduced.
- Consistency across all RPCs within a service: if some RPCs include
  `LocalizedMessage` and some only use `Status.message` for error messages, clients
  have to be aware of which RPCs will do what, or implement a fall-back mechanism.
  Providing `LocalizedMessage` on all RPCs allows simple and consistent client code
  to be written.

### Updating Status.message

If a client has ever observed an error with `Status.message` populated
(which it always will be) but without `ErrorInfo`, the developer of that client
may well have had to resort to parsing `Status.message` in order to find out
information beyond just what `Status.code` conveys. That information may be
found by matching specific text (e.g. "Connection closed with unknown cause")
or by parsing the message to find out metadata values (e.g. a region with
insufficient resources). At that point, `Status.message` is implicitly part
of the API contract, so **must not** be updated - that would be a breaking
change. This is one reason for introducing `LocalizedMessage` into the
`Status.details`.

RPCs which have **always** included `ErrorInfo` are in a better position:
the contract is then more about the stability of `ErrorInfo` for any given
error. The reason and domain need to be consistent over time, and the
metadata provided for any given (reason,domain) can only be expanded.
It's still possible that clients could be parsing `Status.message` instead of
using `ErrorInfo`, but they will always have had a more robust option
available to them.
