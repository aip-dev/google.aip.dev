# Errors

Effective error communication is an important part of designing simple and
intuitive APIs. Services returning standardized error responses enable API
clients to construct centralized common error handling logic. This common logic
simplifies API client applications and eliminates the need for cumbersome
custom error handling code.

## Guidance

Services **must** return a [`google.rpc.Status`][Status] message when an API
error occurs, and **must** use the canonical error codes defined in
[`google.rpc.Code`][Code]. More information about the particular codes is
available in the [gRPC status code documentation][].

Error messages **should** help a reasonably technical user _understand_ and
_resolve_ the issue, and **should not** assume that the user is an expert in
your particular API. Additionally, error messages **must not** assume that the
user will know anything about its underlying implementation.

Error messages **should** be brief but actionable. Any extra information
**should** be provided in the `details` field. If even more information is
necessary, you **should** provide a link where a reader can get more
information or ask questions to help resolve the issue.


A JSON representation of an error response might look like the
following:

<a name="sample"></a>

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 429,
    "message": "The zone 'us-east1-a' does not have enough resources available to fulfill the request. Try a different zone, or try again later.",
    "status": "RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED",
    "details": [
      {
        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.rpc.ErrorInfo",
        "reason": "RESOURCE_AVAILABILITY",
        "domain": "compute.googleapis.com",
        "metadata": {
          "zone": "us-east1-a",
          "vmType": "e2-medium",
          "attachment": "local-ssd=3,nvidia-t4=2",
          "zonesWithCapacity": "us-central1-f,us-central1-c"
        }
      },
      {
        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.rpc.LocalizedMessage",
        "locale": "en-US",
        "message": "An <e2-medium> VM instance with <local-ssd=3,nvidia-t4=2> is currently unavailable in the <us-east1-a> zone.\n Consider trying your request in the <us-central1-f,us-central1-c> zone(s), which currently has/have capacity to accommodate your request.\n Alternatively, you can try your request again with a different VM hardware configuration or at a later time. For more information, see the troubleshooting documentation."
      },
      {
        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.rpc.Help",
        "links": [
          {
            "description": "troubleshooting documentation",
            "url": "https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/resource-error"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Details

Google defines a set of [standard detail payloads][details] for error details,
which cover most common needs for API errors. Services **should** use these
standard details payloads when feasible.

Structured details with machine-readable identifiers **must** be used if users
will need to write code against a specific aspect of the error. Error message
strings **may** change over time; however, if an error message does not have a
machine-readable identifier _in addition to_ the `code` field, changing the
error message **must** be considered a backwards-incompatible change.

#### ErrorInfo

The [`ErrorInfo`][ErrorInfo] message is the required way to send a
machine-readable identifier. All error responses **must** include an
`ErrorInfo` payload in the `details` field. Variable information
**should** be included in the `metadata` field on `ErrorInfo` and
**must** be included if it appears within an error message.

#### Uniqueness

Each type of detail payload **must** be included at most once. For
example, there **must not** be more than one [`BadRequest`][BadRequest]
message in the `details` field, but there **may** be a `BadRequest` and
a [`PreconditionFailure`][PreconditionFailure].

**Note:** `ErrorInfo` represents a special case. There **must** be exactly one
`ErrorInfo`. It is required.

### Error messages

For each error, the service **must** populate the `message` field on
[`google.rpc.Status`][Status]. This error message,

- is a developer-facing, human-readable "debug message"
- is presented in the service's native language
- both explains the error and offers an actionable resolution to it
  ([citation](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors#error_model))

**Note:** Sometimes a service will elect to always present
`Status.message` in English rather than the application's native
language so that messages are easily searchable in common knowledge
bases, such as StackOverflow&trade;.

When introducing an error that represents a failure scenario that did
not previously occur for the service, the payload **must** include
`ErrorInfo` and any variables found in dynamic segments of the error
message **must** be present in `ErrorInfo.metadata`. See, "[Dynamic
variables](#dynamic-variables)".

#### Changing error messages

<a name="status-message-warning"></a>

`Status.message` **may** change. However, **use extreme caution** when
doing so.  API consumers often treat this error message as **part of the
API contract**. Clients perform string matches on the text to
differentiate one error for another and even parse the error message to
extract variables from dynamic segments.

There is a safer alternative. The service can chose to include an error
message by adding [`google.rpc.LocalizedMessage`][LocalizedMessage] to
[`Status.details`][Status details].

The error message presented in `LocalizedMessage.message` **may** be the
same as `Status.message` or it **may** be an alternate message.

Reasons to present the same error message in both locations include the
following:

- The service plans to localize either immediately or in the near
  future.  See, "[Localization](#localization)".
- It affords clients the ability to find an error message consistently
  in one location, `LocalizedMessaage.message`, across all methods of
  the API Service.

Reasons to present an error message in `LocalizedMessage.message` that
differs from `Status.message` include the following:

- The service requires an end-user facing error message that differs
  from the "debug message".
- Ongoing, iterative error message improvements are expected.

When including `LocalizedMessage`, both fields, `locale` and `message`,
**must** be populated.  If the service is to be localized, the value of
`locale` **must** change dynamically. See,
"[Localization](#localization)". Otherwise, `locale` **must** always
present the service's default locale, e.g. "en-US".

When adding an error message via `LocalizedMessage`, `ErrorInfo`
**must** be introduced either before or at the same time. If there are
dynamic segments found in the text, the values of these variables
**must** be included in `ErrorInfo.metadata`.  See, "[Dynamic
variables](#dynamic-variables)".

**Warning:** If `LocalizedMessage` is released without `ErrorInfo`, the
same [concerns](#status-message-warning) regarding client misuse of
textual error messages apply.

#### Dynamic variables

The best, actionable error messages include dynamic segments. These
variable parts of the message are specific to a particular request.
Consider the following example:

> The Book, "The Great Gatsby", is unavailable at the Library, "Garfield
> East". It is expected to be available again on 2199-05-13.

The preceding error message is made actionable by the context, both that
originates from the request, the title of the Book and the name of the
Library, and by the information that is known only by the service, i.e.
the expected return date of the Book.

All dynamic variables found in error messages **must** also be present
in the `map<string, string>`, `ErrorInfo.metadata` (found on the
*required* `ErrorInfo`).  For example, the `metadata` map for the sample
error message above will include *at least* the following key/value
pairs:

```yaml
bookTitle: "The Great Gatsby"
library: "Garfield East"
expectedReturnDate: "2199-05-13"
```

Dynamic variables that do not appear in an error message **may** also be
included in `metadata` to provide additional information to the client
to be used programmatically.

Once present in `metadata`, keys **must** continue to be included in the
map for the error payload to be backwards compatible, even if the value
for a particular key is empty. Keys **must** be expressed as lower
camel-case.

#### Localization

The value of `Status.message` **should** be presented in the service's
native language. If a localized error message is required, the service
**must** include [`google.rpc.LocalizedMessage`][LocalizedMessage] in
`Status.details`.

### Partial errors

APIs **should not** support partial errors. Partial errors add significant
complexity for users, because they usually sidestep the use of error codes, or
move those error codes into the response message, where the user must write
specialized error handling logic to address the problem.

However, occasionally partial errors are necessary, particularly in bulk
operations where it would be hostile to users to fail an entire large request
because of a problem with a single entry.

Methods that require partial errors **should** use [long-running operations][],
and the method **should** put partial failure information in the metadata
message. The errors themselves **must** still be represented with a
[`google.rpc.Status`][Status] object.

### Permission Denied

If the user does not have permission to access the resource or parent,
regardless of whether or not it exists, the service **must** error with
`PERMISSION_DENIED` (HTTP 403). Permission **must** be checked prior to checking
if the resource or parent exists.

If the user does have proper permission, but the requested resource or parent
does not exist, the service **must** error with `NOT_FOUND` (HTTP 404).

## Rationale

### Requiring ErrorInfo

`ErrorInfo` is required because it further identifies an error. With
only approximately twenty [available values][Code] for `Status.status`,
it is difficult to disambiguate one error from another across an entire
[API Service][API Service].

Also, error messages often contain dynamic segments that express
variable information, so there needs to be machine readable component of
*every* error response that enables clients to use such information
programmatically.

### LocalizedMessage

`LocalizedMessage` was selected as the location to present alternate
error messages. This is desirable when clients need to display a crafted
error message directly to end users. `LocalizedMessage` can be used with
a static `locale`. This may seem misleading, but it allows the service
to eventually localize without having to duplicate or move the error
message, which would be a backwards incompatible change.
