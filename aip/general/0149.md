# Unset field values

In many messages, many fields are optional: the user is not required to provide
them, or for output fields, the service might not populate the field.

In most cases, there is no meaningful difference between setting it to a
default value (such as `0`) as opposed to not setting it at all; however,
occasionally this distinction is meaningful.

## Guidance

Services defined in protocol buffers **should** use the `optional` keyword for
primitives if and only if it is necessary to distinguish setting the field to
its default value (`0`, `false`, or empty string) from not setting it at all:

```proto
// A representation of a book in a library.
message Book {
  // The name of the book.
  string name = 1;

  // The rating for the book, from 0 to 5.
  // 0 is distinct from no rating.
  optional int32 rating = 2;
}
```

**Important:** Services **should not** need to distinguish between the default
value and unset most of the time; if an alternative design does not require
such a distinction, it is usually preferred. In practice, this means `optional`
**should** only ever be used for integers and floats.
