# API Contract

Every API needs a clear contract which clients can easily understand.
Occasionally, certain parts of the contract may be restricted for use under
specific conditions such as based on the identity of the caller.

## Guidance

The API contract **must** be an explicit part of the API method and request
message. Specifically:

*   Successful identical requests to the same method **must** have the same
    behavior.
*   Requests **may** be rejected as per [AIP-193](/193) if the request cannot be
    completed due to requirements on the context such as the identity of the
    caller.
*   Services **may** define custom methods for related but distinct purposes
    rather than capturing it in request fields as long as they adhere to the
    guidance in [AIP-136](/136).
