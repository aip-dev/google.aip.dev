# Standard methods: Update

In REST APIs, it is customary to make a `PATCH` or `PUT` request to a
resource's URI (for example, `/v1/publishers/{publisher}/books/{book}`) in
order to update that resource.

Resource-oriented design ([AIP-121][]) honors this pattern through the `Update`
method (which mirrors the REST `PATCH` behavior). These RPCs accept the URI
representing that resource and return the resource.

## Guidance

APIs **should** generally provide an update method for resources unless it is
not valuable for users to do so. The purpose of the update method is to make
changes to the resources without causing side effects.

Update methods are specified using the following pattern:

```proto
rpc UpdateBook(UpdateBookRequest) returns (Book) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    patch: "/v1/{book.name=publishers/*/books/*}"
    body: "book"
  };
  option (google.api.method_signature) = "book,update_mask";
}
```

- The RPC's name **must** begin with the word `Update`. The remainder of the
  RPC name **should** be the singular form of the resource's message name.
- The request message **must** match the RPC name, with a `-Request` suffix.
- The response message **must** be the resource itself. (There is no
  `UpdateBookResponse`.)
  - The response **should** include the fully-populated resource, and **must**
    include any fields that were sent and included in the update mask unless
    they are input only (see [AIP-203][]).
  - If the update RPC is [long-running](#long-running-update), the response
    message **must** be a `google.longrunning.Operation` which resolves to the
    resource itself.
- The method **should** support partial resource update, and the HTTP verb
  **should** be `PATCH`.
  - If the method will only ever support full resource replacement, then the
    HTTP verb **may** be `PUT`. However, this is strongly discouraged because
    it becomes a backwards-incompatible change to add fields to the resource.
- The resource's `name` field **should** map to the URI path.
  - The `{resource}.name` field **should** be the only variable in the URI
    path.
- There **must** be a `body` key in the `google.api.http` annotation, and it
  **must** map to the resource field in the request message.
  - All remaining fields **should** map to URI query parameters.
- There **should** be exactly one `google.api.method_signature` annotation,
  with a value of `"{resource},update_mask"`.

**Note:** Unlike the other four standard methods, the URI path here references
a nested field (`book.name`) in the example. If the resource field has a word
separator, `snake_case` is used.

### Request message

Update methods implement a common request message pattern:

```proto
message UpdateBookRequest {
  // The book to update.
  //
  // The book's `name` field is used to identify the book to be updated.
  // Format: publishers/{publisher}/books/{book}
  Book book = 1 [(google.api.field_behavior) = REQUIRED];

  // The list of fields to be updated.
  google.protobuf.FieldMask update_mask = 2;
}
```

- The request message **must** contain a field for the resource.
  - The field **must** map to the `PATCH` body.
  - The field **should** be annotated as required.
  - A `name` field **must** be included in the resource message. It **should**
    be called `name`.
- A field mask **should** be included in order to support partial update. It
  **must** be of type `google.protobuf.FieldMask`, and it **should** be called
  `update_mask`.
  - The fields used in the field mask correspond to the resource being updated
    (not the request message).
  - The field **may** be required or optional. If it is required, it **should**
    include the corresponding annotation.
- The request message **must not** contain any other required fields, and
  **should not** contain other optional fields except those described in this
  or another AIP.

### Side effects

In general, update methods are intended to update the data within the resource.
Update methods **should not** trigger other side effects. Instead, side effects
**should** be triggered by custom methods.

In particular, this entails that [state fields][] **must not** be directly
writable in update methods.

### PATCH and PUT

**TL;DR:** Google APIs generally use the `PATCH` HTTP verb only, and do not
support `PUT` requests.

We standardize on `PATCH` because Google updates stable APIs in place with
backwards-compatible improvements. It is often necessary to add a new field to
an existing resource, but this becomes a breaking change when using `PUT`.

To illustrate this, consider a `PUT` request to a `Book` resource:

    PUT /v1/publishers/123/books/456

    {"title": "Mary Poppins", "author": "P.L. Travers"}

Next consider that the resource is later augmented with a new field (here we
add `rating`):

```proto
message Book {
  string title = 1;
  string author = 2;

  // Subsequently added to v1 in place...
  int32 rating = 3;
}
```

If a rating is set on a book and the existing `PUT` request was executed, it
would wipe out the book's rating. In essence, a `PUT` request unintentionally
wiped out data because the previous version did not know about it.

### Long-running update

Some resources take longer to update a resource than is reasonable for a
regular API request. In this situation, the API **should** use a long-running
operation ([AIP-151][]) instead:

```proto
rpc UpdateBook(UpdateBookRequest) returns (google.longrunning.Operation) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    patch: "/v1/{book.name=publishers/*/books/*}"
  };
  option (google.longrunning.operation_info) = {
    response_type: "Book"
    metadata_type: "OperationMetadata"
  }
}
```

- The response type **must** be set to the resource (what the return type would
  be if the RPC was not long-running).
- Both the `response_type` and `metadata_type` fields **must** be specified.

### Create or update

If the API accepts client-assigned resource names, the server **may** allow the
client to specify a non-existent resource name and create a new resource
(effectively implementing the "upsert" concept). Otherwise, the Update method
**should** fail with `NOT_FOUND`.

An API with an update method that supports resource creation **should** also
provide a [create][] method, because otherwise it may not be clear to users how
to create resources.

### Etags

An API may sometimes need to allow users to send update requests which are
guaranteed to be made against the most current data (a common use case for this
is to detect and avoid race conditions). Resources which need to enable this do
so by including a `string etag` field, which contains an opaque,
server-computed value representing the content of the resource.

In this situation, the resource **should** contain a `string etag` field:

```proto
message Book {
  // The resource name of the book.
  // Format: publishers/{publisher}/books/{book}
  string name = 1;

  // The title of the book.
  // Example: "Mary Poppins"
  string title = 2;

  // The author of the book.
  // Example: "P.L. Travers"
  string author = 3;

  // The etag for this book.
  // If this is provided on update, it must match the server's etag.
  string etag = 4;
}
```

The `etag` field **may** be either [required][] or [optional][]. If it is set,
then the request **must** succeed if and only if the provided etag matches the
server-computed value, and **must** fail with a `FAILED_PRECONDITION` error
otherwise. The `update_mask` field in the request does not affect the behavior
of the `etag` field, as it is not a field _being_ updated.

### Expensive fields

APIs sometimes encounter situations where some fields on a resource are
expensive or impossible to reliably return.

This can happen in a few situations:

- A resource may have some fields that are very expensive to compute, and that
  are generally not useful to the customer on update requests.
- A single resource sometimes represents an amalgamation of data from multiple
  underlying (and eventually consistent) data sources. In these situations, it
  is impossible to return authoritative information on the fields that were not
  changed.

In this situation, an API **may** return back only the fields that were
updated, and omit the rest, and **should** document this behavior if they do
so.

### Errors

If the user does not have permission to access the resource, regardless of
whether or not it exists, the service **must** error with `PERMISSION_DENIED`
(HTTP 403). Permission **must** be checked prior to checking if the resource
exists.
