# Resource Revisions

Some APIs need to have resources with a revision history, where users can
reason about the state of the resource over time. There are several reasons for
this:

- Users may want to be able to roll back to a previous revision, or diff
  against a previous revision.
- An API may create data which is derived in some way from a resource at a
  given point in time. In these cases, it may be desirable to snapshot the
  resource for reference later.

**Note:** We use the word _revision_ to refer to a historical reference for a
particular resource, and intentionally avoid the term _version_, which refers
to the version of an API as a whole.

## Guidance

APIs **may** store a revision history for a resource. Examples of when it is
useful include:

- When it is valuable to expose older versions of a resource via an API. This
  can avoid the overhead of the customers having to write their own API to store
  and enable retrieval of revisions.
- Other resources depend on different revisions of a resource.
- There is a need to represent the change of a resource over time.

APIs implementing resources with a revision history **should** abstract resource
revisions as nested collection of the resource. Sometimes, the revisions
collection can be a top level collection, exceptions include:

- If resource revisions are meant to have longer lifespan than the parent
resource. In other words, resource revisions exist after resource deletion.


```proto
message BookRevision {
  // The name of the book revision.
  string name = 1;

  // The snapshot of the book
  Book snapshot = 2
    [(google.api.field_behavior) = OUTPUT_ONLY];

  // The timestamp that the revision was created.
  google.protobuf.Timestamp create_time = 3
    [(google.api.field_behavior) = OUTPUT_ONLY];

  // Other revision IDs that share the same snapshot.
  repeated string alternate_ids = 4
    [(google.api.field_behavior) = OUTPUT_ONLY];
}
```

- The `message` **must** be annotated as a resource (AIP-123).
- The `message` name **must** be named `{ResourceType}Revision`.
- The resource revision **must** contain a field with a message type of the
  parent resource, with a field name of `snapshot`.
  - The value of `snapshot` **must** be the configuration of the parent
    at the point in time the revision was created.
- The resource revision **must** contain a `create_time` field (see [AIP-142][]).
- The resource revision **may** contain a repeated field `alternate_ids`, which would
  contain a list of resource IDs that the revision is also known by (e.g. `latest`)

### Creating Revisions

Depending on the resource, different APIs may have different strategies for

- Create a new revision any time that there is a change to the parent resource
- Create a new revision when important system state changes
- Create a new revision when specifically requested

APIs **may** use any of these strategies. APIs **must**
document their revision creation strategy.

### Resource names for revisions

When referring to specific revision of a resource, the subcollection name
**must** be named `revisions`. Resource revisions have names with the format
`{resource_name}/revisions/{revision_id}`. For example:
```
publishers/123/books/les-miserables/revisions/c7cfa2a8
```

### Server-specified Aliases

Services **may** reserve specific IDs to be [aliases][alias] (e.g.
`latest`). These are read-only and managed by the service.

```
GET /v1/publishers/{publisher}/books/{book}/revisions/{revision_id}
```

- If a `latest` ID exists, it **must** represent the most recently created
revision. The content of `publishers/{publisher}/books/{book}/revisions/latest`
and `publishers/{publisher}/books/{book}` can differ, as the latest revision may
be different from the current state of the resource.

### User-Specified Aliases

APIs **may** provide a mechanism for users to assign an [alias][] ID to an
existing revision with a custom method "alias":

```proto
rpc AliasBookRevision(AliasBookRevisionRequest) returns (Book) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    post: "/v1/{name=publishers/*/books/*/revisions/*}:alias"
    body: "*"
  };
}
```

```proto
message AliasBookRevisionRequest {
  string name = 1 [
    (google.api.field_behavior) = REQUIRED,
    (google.api.resource_reference) = {
      type: "library.googleapis.com/BookRevision"
    }];

  // The ID of the revision to alias to, e.g. `CURRENT` or a semantic
  // version.
  string alias_id = 2 [(google.api.field_behavior) = REQUIRED];
}
```

- The request message **must** have a `name` field:
  - The field **must** be [annotated as required][aip-203].
  - The field **must** identify the [resource type][aip-123] that it
    references.
- The request message **must** have a `alias_id` field:
  - The field **must** be [annotated as required][aip-203].
- If the user calls the method with an existing `alias_id`, the request **must**
  succeed and the alias will be updated to refer to the provided revision. This
  allows users to write code against a specific alias (e.g. `published`) and the
  revision can change with no code change.

### Rollback

A common use case for a resource with a revision history is the ability to roll
back to a given revision. APIs **should** handle this with a `Rollback` custom
method:

```proto
rpc RollbackBook(RollbackBookRequest) returns (BookRevision) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    post: "/v1/{name=publishers/*/books/*/revisions/*}:rollback"
    body: "*"
  };
}
```

- The method **must** use the `POST` HTTP verb.
- The method **should** return a resource revision.

```proto
message RollbackBookRequest {
  // The revision that the book should be rolled back to.
  string name = 1 [
    (google.api.field_behavior) = REQUIRED,
    (google.api.resource_reference) = {
      type: "library.googleapis.com/BookRevision"
    }];
}
```

- The request message **must** have a `name` field, referring to the resource
  revision whose configuration the resource should be rolled back to.
  - The field **must** be [annotated as required][aip-203].
  - The field **must** identify the [resource type][aip-123] that it
    references.

### Child resources

Resources with a revision history **may** have child resources. If they do,
there are two potential variants:

- Child resources where each child resource is a child of the parent resource
  as a whole.
- Child resources where each child resource is a child of _a single revision
  of_ the parent resource.

APIs **should not** include multiple levels of resources with revisions, as
this quickly becomes difficult to reason about.

### Standard methods

Any standard methods **must** implement the corresponding AIPs (AIP-131,
AIP-132, AIP-133, AIP-134, AIP-135), with the following additional behaviors:

- List methods: By default, revisions in the list response **must** be ordered
  in reverse chronological order. User can supply `order_by` to override the
  default behavior.
- If the revision supports aliasing, a delete method with the resource name
  of the alias (e.g. `revisions/1.0.2`) **must** remove the alias instead of
  deleting the resource.

As revisions are nested under the resource, also see [cascading delete][].

## Rationale

### Abstract revisions as nested collection

Revisions being resources under nested collection make revisions a first class
citizen.

- Revisions can offer standard get, list, and delete methods.
- It retains the flexibility of extending new fields to revision in addition to
  the resource message.

### Tagging to Aliases

Previously, a concept of `tag` existed. This concept was redundant with that of
an [alias][], and the terms were consolidated to reduce complexity in the AIPs.

### Output only resource configuration

Although it was an option to have the revision take in the resource
configuration as part of the create method, doing so would have allowed users to
submit resource configuration for a revision that the resource was never in.

`OUTPUT_ONLY` and requiring that a created revision represents the resource at
current point in time eliminates that issue.

## History

### Switching from a collection extension to a subcollection

In 2023-09, revisions are abstracted as a nested resource collection. Prior to
this, revisions are more like extension of an existing resource by using `@`
symbol. List and delete revisions were custom methods on the resource
collection. A single Get method was used to retrieve either the resource
revision, or the resource.

Its primary advantage was allowing a resource reference to seamlessly refer to
a resource, or its revision.

It also had several disadvantages:

-  List revisions is a custom method (:listRevisions) on the resource collection
-  Delete revision is a custom method on the resource collection
-  Not visible in API discovery doc
-  Resource ID cannot use `@`

The guidance was modified ultimately to enable revisions to behave like a
resource, which reduces the users cognitive load and allows resource-oriented
clients to easily list, get, create, and update revisions.

### Using resource ID instead of tag

In the previous design, revisions had a separate identifer for a revision known
as a `tag`, that would live in a revision.

Tags were effectively a shadow resource ID, requiring methods to create, get and
filter revisions based on the value of the tag.

By consolidating the concept of a tag into the revision ID, the user no longer
needs to be familiar with a second set of retrieval and identifier methods.
