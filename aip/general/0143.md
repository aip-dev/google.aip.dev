# Standardized codes

Many common concepts, such as spoken languages, countries, currency, and so on,
have common codes (usually formalized by the [International Organization for
Standardization][iso]) that are used in data communication and processing.
These codes address the issue that there are often different ways to express
the same concept in written language (for example, "United States" and "USA",
or "Espa√±ol" and "Spanish").

## Guidance

For concepts where a standardized code exists and is in common use, fields
representing these concepts **should** use the standardized code for both input
and output.

```proto
// A message representing a book.
message Book {
  // Other fields...

  // The IETF BCP-47 language code representing the language in which
  // the book was originally written.
  // https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag
  string language_code = 99;
}
```

- Fields representing standardized concepts **must** use the appropriate data
  type for the standard code (usually `string`).
  - Fields representing standardized concepts **should not** use enums, even if
    they only allow a small subset of possible values. Using enums in this
    situation often leads to frustrating lookup tables when using multiple APIs
    together.
  - Fields representing standardized concepts **must** indicate which standard
    they follow, preferably with a link (either to the standard itself, the
    Wikipedia description, or something similar).
- The field name **should** end in `_code` or `_type` unless the concept has an
  obviously clearer suffix.
- When accepting values provided by users, validation **should** be
  case-insensitive unless this would introduce ambiguity (for example, accept
  both `en-gb` and `en-GB`). When providing values to users, APIs **should**
  use the canonical case (in the example above, `en-GB`).

### Content types

Fields representing a content or media type **must** use [IANA media types][].
For legacy reasons, the field **should** be called `mime_type`.

### Countries and regions

Fields representing individual countries or nations **must** use the [Unicode
CLDR region codes][cldr] ([list][]), such as `US` or `CH`, and the field
**must** be called `region_code`.

**Important:** Please read the [rationale](#countryregion-field-naming) for this
requirement.

### Currency

Fields representing currency **must** use [ISO-4217 currency codes][iso-4217],
such as `USD` or `CHF`, and the field **must** be called `currency_code`.

**Note:** For representing an amount of money in a particular currency, rather
than the currency code itself, use [`google.type.Money`][money].

### Language

Fields representing spoken languages **must** use [IETF BCP-47 language
codes][bcp-47] ([list][]), such as `en-US` or `de-CH`, and the field **must**
be called `language_code`.

### Time zones

Fields representing a time zone **should** use the [IANA TZ][] codes, and the
field **must** be called `time_zone`.

Fields also **may** represent a UTC offset rather than a time zone (note that
these are subtly different). In this case, the field **must** use the [ISO-8601
format][] to represent this, and the field **must** be named `utc_offset`.

## Rationale

### Country/region field naming

The use of `region_code` instead of `country_code` is critical to being able to
convey regions that are distinct from any country and to avoid any political
disputes associated with said region regarding their soverignty or affiliation.
Google and many other companies are supporters of Unicode CLDR and standardize
their product internationalization efforts on Unicode CLDR, and APIs are no
different here. Furthermore, many of the values supported by Unicode CLDR are
not countries on their own, so using a more generic name is actually more
compatible with the specification.

## Changelog

- **2024-12-03**: Strengthen rationale of country/region field naming
- **2024-11-12**: Change country/region code list to CLDR list from IANA list
- **2020-05-12**: Replaced `country_code` guidance with `region_code`,
  correcting an original error.
