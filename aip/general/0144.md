# Repeated fields

Representing lists of data in an API is trickier than it often appears. Users
often need to modify lists in place, and longer data series within a single
resource pose a challenge for pagination.

## Guidance

Resources **may** use repeated fields where appropriate.

```proto
message Book {
  string name = 1;
  repeated string authors = 2;
}
```

- Repeated fields **must** use a plural field name.
  - If the English singular and plural words are identical ("moose", "info"),
    the dictionary word **must** be used rather than attempting to coin a new
    plural form.
- Repeated fields **should** have an enforced upper bound that will not cause a
  single resource payload to become too large. A good rule of thumb is 100
  elements.
  - If repeated data has the chance of being too large, the API **should** use
    a sub-resource instead.
- Repeated fields **must not** represent the body of another resource inline.
  Instead, the message **should** provide the resource names of the associated
  resources.

### Scalars and messages

Repeated fields **should** use a scalar type (such as `string`) if they are
certain that additional data will not be needed in the future, as using a
message type adds significant cognitive overhead and leads to more complicated
code.

However, if additional data is likely to be needed in the future, repeated
fields **should** use a message instead of a scalar proactively, to avoid
parallel repeated fields.

### Update strategies

A resource **may** use two strategies to enable updating a repeated field:
direct update using the [standard `Update`][aip-134] method, or custom `Add`
and `Remove` methods.

A standard `Update` method has one key limitation: the user is only able to
update _the entire_ list. Field masks are unable to address individual entries
in a repeated field. This means that the user must read the resource, make
modifications to the repeated field value as needed, and send it back. This is
fine for many situations, particularly when the repeated field is expected to
have a small size (fewer than 10 or so) and race conditions are not an issue,
or can be guarded against with [ETags][aip-154].

If atomic modifications are required, the API **should** define custom methods
using the verbs `Add` and `Remove`:

```proto
rpc AddAuthor(AddAuthorRequest) returns (AddAuthorResponse) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    post: "/v1/{book=publishers/*/books/*}:addAuthor"
    body: "*"
  };
}

rpc RemoveAuthor(RemoveAuthorRequest) returns (RemoveAuthorResponse) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    post: "/v1/{book=publishers/*/books/*}:removeAuthor"
    body: "*"
  };
}
```

- The data being added or removed **should** be a primitive (usually a
  `string`).
  - For more complex data structures with a primary key, the API **should** use
    a map with the `Update` method instead.
- The HTTP verb **must** be `POST`, as is usual for [custom methods][aip-136].
- The HTTP variable **should** be the name of the resource (such as `book`)
  rather than `name` or `parent`.
- If the data being added in an `Add` RPC is already present, the method
  **must** error with `ALREADY_EXISTS`.
- If the data being removed in a `Remove` RPC is not present, the method
  **must** error with `NOT_FOUND`.

**Note:** If both of these strategies are too restrictive, consider using a
subresource instead.
