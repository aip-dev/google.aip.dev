# Glossary

In the name of brevity, this AIP defines some common terminology here rather
than in each AIP individually.

## Guidance

The following terminology **should** be used consistently throughout AIPs.

### API

Application Programming Interface. This can be a local interface (such as
a client library) or a Network API (defined below).

### API Backend

A set of servers and related infrastructure that implements the
business logic for an API Service. An individual API backend server is often
called an API server.

### API Consumer

The entity that consumes an API Service. For Google APIs, it
typically is a Google project that owns the client application or the server
resource.

### API Definition

The definition of an API, usually defined in a Protocol Buffer
service. An API Definition can be implemented by any number of API Services.

### API Frontend

A set of servers plus related infrastructure that provides
common functionality across API Services, such as load balancing and
authentication. An individual API frontend server is often called an API proxy.

**Note:** the API frontend and the API backend may run next to each other or
far away from each other. In some cases, they can be compiled into a single
application binary and run inside a single process.

### API Method

An individual operation within an API. It is typically represented
in Protocol Buffers by an `rpc` definition, and is mapped to a function in the
API in most programming languages.

### API Producer

The entity that produces an API Service. For Google APIs, it
typically is a Google team responsible for the API Service.

### API Product

An API Service and its related components, such as Terms of
Service, documentation, client libraries, and service support, are collectively
presented to customers as a API Product. For example, Google Calendar API.

**Note:** people sometimes refer to an API Product simply as an API.

### API Service

A deployed implementation of one or more APIs, exposed on one or
more network addresses, such as the Cloud Pub/Sub API.

### API Service Definition

The combination of API Definitions (`.proto` files)
and API Service configurations (`.yaml` files) used to define an API Service.
The schema for Google API Service Definition is `google.api.Service`.

### API Service Endpoint

Refers to a network address that an API Service uses to
handle incoming API Requests. One API Service may have multiple API Service
Endpoints, such as `https://pubsub.googleapis.com` and
`https://content-pubsub.googleapis.com`.

### API Service Name

Refers to the logical identifier of an API Service. Google
APIs use RFC 1035 DNS compatible names as their API Service Names, such as
`pubsub.googleapis.com`.

### API Request

A single invocation of an API Method. It is often used as the
unit for billing, logging, monitoring, and rate limiting.

### API Version

The version of an API or a group of APIs if they are defined
together. An API Version is often represented by a string, such as "v1", and
presents in API requests and Protocol Buffers package names.

### Client

Code that calls the API or operates on the resource data at rest. These clients
may be a program that performs a specific task on an API, or be a generic tool
that exposes the API in a more user-accessible fashion (e.g. a command line
interface).

Examples of clients include:

- A command line interface.
- A library, such as an SDK for a particular programming language.
- A script that operates on a JSON representation of a resource after reading it
  from an API.
- A tool, such as an [IaC][] client.
- A visual UI, such as a web application.

### Google API

A Network API exposed by a Google service. Most of these are
hosted on the `googleapis.com` domain. It does not include other types of APIs,
such as client libraries and SDKs.

### IaC

Short for Infrastructure-as-code, IaC describes a category of clients that
consumes a markup language or code that represents resources exposed by an API,
and executes the appropriate imperative actions to drive the resource to that
desired state.

Examples of complexities that IaC clients abstract away include:

- Determing the appropriate imperative action (create / update / delete) to achieve desired state.
- Ordering of these imperative actions.

[Terraform][] is an example of such a client.

### User

A human being which is using an API. This term is defined to differentiate usage
in the AIPs between a human *user* and a programmatic *client*.

### Network API

An API that operates across a network of computers. Network APIs
communicate using network protocols including HTTP, and are frequently produced
by organizations separate from those that consume them.
