# Unreachable resources

Occasionally, a user may ask for a list of resources, and some set of resources
in the list are temporarily unavailable. For example, a user may ask to list
resources across multiple parent locations, but one of those locations is
temporarily unreachable. In this situation, it is still desirable to provide
the user with all the available resources, while indicating that something is
missing.

## Guidance

If a method to retrieve data is capable of partially failing due to one or more
resources being temporarily unreachable, the response message **must** include
a field to indicate this:

```proto
message ListBooksResponse {
  // The books matching the request.
  repeated Book books = 1;

  // The next page token, if there are more books matching the
  // request.
  string next_page_token = 2;

  // Unreachable resources.
  repeated string unreachable = 3;
}
```

- The field **must** be a repeated string, and **should** be named
  `unreachable`.
- The field **must** contain the resource names of the resources that are
  unreachable or those that impede reaching the requested collection, such as
  the parent resource of the collection that could not be reached.
  - For example, if an entire location is unreachable, preventing access to the
    localized collection of resources requested, the location resource is
    included.
- The field **must** contain _service-relative_ resource names, and **must not**
  contain full resource names, resource URIs, or simple resource IDs. See
  [AIP-122][aip-122] for definitions.
  - For example, if a `Book` resource is unreachable, the _service-relative_
    resource name `"shelves/scifi1/books/starwars4"` would appear in
    `unreachable`, as opposed to the _full_ resource name
    `"//library.googleapis.com/shelves/scifi1/books/starwars4"`, the
    _parent-relative_ resource `"books/starwars4"`, the resource ID
    `"starwars4"`, or the resource URI.
- The response **must not** provide any other information about the issue(s)
  that made the listed resources unreachable.
  - For example, the response cannot contain an extra field with error reasons
    for each `unreachable` entry.
- The service **must** provide a way for the user to make a more specific
  request and receive an error with additional information e.g. via a Standard
  Get or a Standard List targeted at the unreachable collection parent.
  - The service **must** also allow the user to repeat the original call with
    more restrictive parameters.
- The resource names that appear in `unreachable` **may** be heterogeneous.
  - The `unreachable` field definition **should** document what potential
    resources could be provided in this field, and note that it might expand
    later.
  - For example, if both an entire location and a specific resource in a
    different location are unreachable, the unreachable location's name 
    e.g. `"projects/example123/locations/us-east1"` and the unreachable
    resource's name e.g.
    `"projects/example123/locations/europe-west2/instances/example456"` will
    both appear in `unreachable`.

**Important:** If a single unreachable location or resource prevents returning
any data by definition (for example, a list request for a single publisher
where that publisher is unreachable), the service **must** fail the entire
request with an error.

### Pagination

When paginating over a list, it is likely that the service will not know that
there are unreachable parents or resources initially. Further, parents may
alternate between being available and unavailable in unpredictable ways
throughout the process of listing all the requested resources.

These facts lead to the following guidance:

- The response **must** provide any outstanding unreachable locations or
  resources in the `unreachable` field on pages _following_ the final page that
  contains a resource.
  - The response **should not** include both requested data and unreachable
    resources on the same page.
    - For example, if there are two pages of books and one unavailable
      publisher, there should be three pages total: first the two pages of
      books, and then a final page with no books and the unavailable publisher.
  - If the number of unreachable resources to list is very large, the response
    **should** honor the `page_size` field in the same way as for resources. In
    this case, all pages with requested information **should** precede all
    pages with unavailable resources or locations.
  - The final page's `unreachable` field **must** _only_ include resources or
    parents that were partially provided (or missing completely) across the
    entirety of the pagination process.
    - For example, if a parent or resource was unreachable at the beginning of
      pagination and it became reachable again and the entire set of previously
      unreachable data was provided to the user on any page, the `unreachable`
      field **must not** include the intermittently-unreachable parent or
      resource.
    - On the other hand, if only _some_ of the resources for a given parent are
      provided during such an incident as described above, the parent or
      resource **must** be included in the `unreachable` field.

### Adopting partial succcess

In order for an existing API that has a default behavior *differing* from the
aforementioned guidance i.e. the API call returns an error status instead of a
partial result, to adopt the `unreachable` pattern the API **must** do the
following:

- The default behavior **must** be retained to avoid incompatible behavioral
  changes
  - For example, if the default behavior is to return an error if any location
    is unreachable, that default behavior **must** be retained.
- The request message **must** have a `bool return_partial_success` field
- The response message **must** have the standard
  `repeated string unreachable` field
- The two aforementioned fields **must** be added simultaneously

When the `bool return_partial_success` field is set to `true` in a request, the
API **must** behave as described in the aforementioned guidance with regards to
populating the `repeated string unreachable` response field.

```proto
message ListBooksRequest {
  // Standard List request fields...

  // Setting this field to `true` will opt the request into returning the
  // resources that are reachable, and into including the names of those that
  // were unreachable in the [ListBooksResponse.unreachable] field. This can
  // only be `true` when reading across collections e.g. when `parent` is set to
  //  `"projects/example/locations/-"`.
  bool return_partial_success = 4;
}

message ListBooksResponse {
  // Standard List Response fields...

  // Unreachable resources. Populated when the request opts into
  // `return_partial_success` and reading across collections e.g. when
  // attempting to list all resources across all supported locations.
  repeated string unreachable = 3;
}
```

#### Partial success granularity

If the `bool return_partial_success` field is set to `true` in a request that is
scoped beyond the supported granualirty of the API's ability to reasonably
report unreachable resources, the API **should** return an `INVALID_ARGUMENT`
error with details explaining the issue. For example, if the API only supports
`return_partial_success` when [Reading Across Collections][aip159], it returns
an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error when given a request scoped to a specific parent
resource collection. The supported granularity **must** be documented on the
`return_partial_success` field.

## Rationale

### Using service-relative resource names

In general, relative resource names, as defined in AIP-122, are the best
practice for referring to resources by name _within_ a service and in other
services when that other service is obvious. The full resource name format is
strictly less consumable (e.g., requires extra parsing client side), and
over-specified for the uses of `unreachable`. Resource URIs are not transport
agnostic, as they are unusable in standard methods for gRPC users, and simple
resource IDs do not provide enough information about exactly which resource
was unreachable in a heterogenous list of resources.

### Minimizing extra error details in response

The context in which an unreachable resource is discovered may be sensitive and
the state of the system fluid between calls. As such, it is preferred to defer
to the service by making a more specific RPC to get more details about a
specific resource or parent. This allows the parent to handle all necessary RPC
checks and system state resolution on at time of request, rather than by
shoehorning potentially privileged or stale information into the broader list
call it was unreachable for.

### Using request field to opt-in

Introducing a new request field as means of opting into the partial success
behavior is the best way to communicate user intent while keeping the 
default behavior backwards compatible. The alternative, changing the default
behavior with the introduction of the `unreachable` response field, presents
a backwards incompatible change. Users that previously expected failure when any
resource was unreachable, assume the successful response means all resources
are accounted for in the response.

### Introducing fields simultaneously

Introducing the request and response fields simultaneously is to prevent an
invalid intermediate state that is presented by only adding one or the other. If
only `unreachable` is added, then it could be assumed that it being empty means
all resources were returned when that may not be true. If only
`return_partial_success` is added, then the user wouldn't have a means of
knowing which resources were unreachable.

### Partial success granularity limitations

At a certain level of request scope granularity, an API is simply unable to
enumerate the resources that are unreachable. For example, global-only APIs may
be unable to provide granularity at a localized collection level. In such a
case, preemptively returning an error when `return_partial_success=true`
protects the user from the risks of the alternative - expecting unreachable
resources if there was an issue, but not getting any, thus falsely assuming
everything was retrieved. This aligns with guidance herein that suggests failing
requests that cannot be fulfilled preemptively.
