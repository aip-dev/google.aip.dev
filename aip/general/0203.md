# Field behavior documentation

When defining fields in protocol buffers, it is customary to explain to users
certain aspects of the field's behavior (such as whether it is required or
optional). Additionally, it can be useful for other tools to understand this
behavior (for example, to optimize client library signatures).

## Guidance

APIs use the `google.api.field_behavior` annotation to describe well-understood
field behavior, such as a field being required or immutable.

```proto
// The audio data to be recognized.
RecognitionAudio audio = 2 [(google.api.field_behavior) = REQUIRED];
```

- APIs **must** apply the `google.api.field_behavior` annotation on every field
  non a message or sub-message used in a request, except for the [name](#name).
- The annotation **must** include any [google.api.FieldBehavior][] values that
  accurately describe the behavior of the field.
  - `FIELD_BEHAVIOR_UNSPECIFIED` **must not** be used.
- APIs **must** at minimum use one of `REQUIRED`, `OPTIONAL`, or `OUTPUT_ONLY`.

**Warning:** Although `field_behavior` does not impact proto-level behavior,
many clients (e.g. CLIs and SDKs) rely on them to generate code. Thoroughly
review and consider which values are relevant when adding a new field.

Fields with no annotation are interpreted as `OPTIONAL` for
backwards-compatility. Nontheless, this annotation **must not** be omitted.

**Note:** The vocabulary given in this document is for _descriptive_ purposes
only, and does not itself add any validation. The purpose is to consistently
document this behavior for clients.

### Annotating Name

The `name` field of a resource **must not** be annotated.

Since the resource name (see AIP-122) is used in a variety of contexts in which some are
`OUTPUT_ONLY`, `REQUIRED`, and `IMMUTABLE`, clients **should** have special
handling for that field based on the request.

## Vocabulary

### Required

The use of `REQUIRED` indicates that the field **must** be present (and set to
a non-empty value) on the request or resource.

A field **should** only be described as required if _either_:

- It is a field on a resource that a user provides somewhere as input. In this
  case, the resource is only valid if a "truthy" value is _stored_.
  - When [creating][aip-133] the resource, a value **must** be provided for the
    field on the create request.
  - When [updating][aip-134] the resource, the user **may** omit the field
    provided that the field is also absent from the field mask, indicating no
    change to the field (otherwise it **must** be provided).
- It is a field on a request message (a message that is an argument to an RPC,
  with a name usually ending in `Request`). In this case, a value **must** be
  provided as part of the request, and failure to do so **must** cause an error
  (usually `INVALID_ARGUMENT`).

We define the term "truthy" above as follows:

- For primitives, values other than `0`, `0.0`, empty string/bytes, and `false`
- For repeated fields maps, values with at least one entry
- For messages, any message with at least one "truthy" field.

Fields **should not** be described as required in order to signify:

- A field which will always be present in a response.
- A field which is conditionally required in some situations.
- A field on any message (including messages that are resources) which is never
  used as user input.

**Note:** In most cases, empty values (such as `false` for booleans, `0` for
integers, or the unspecified value for enums) are indistinguishable from unset
values, and therefore setting a required field to a falsy value yields an
error. A corollary to this is that a required boolean must be set to `true`.

### Optional

The use of `OPTIONAL` indicates that a field is not required.

A field **may** be described as optional if it is a field on a request message
(a message that is an argument to an RPC, usually ending in `Request`), or a
field on a submessage.

### Output only

The use of `OUTPUT_ONLY` indicates that the field is provided in responses, but
that including the field in a message in a request does nothing (the server
**must** clear out any value in this field and **must not** throw an error as a
result of the presence of a value in this field on input). Similarly, services
**must** ignore the presence of output only fields in update field masks.

Additionally, a field **should** only be described as output only if it is a
field in a resource message, or a field of a message farther down the tree.
Notably, fields in response messages (a message which only ever acts as a
return value to an RPC, usually ending in `Response`) **should not** be
described as output only because this is already implied.

Output only fields **may** be set to empty values if appropriate to the API.

Potential use cases for output only fields (this is not an exhaustive list)
are:

- Create or update timestamps.
- Derived or structured information based on original user input.
- Properties of a resource assigned by the service which can not be altered.

### Input only

The use of `INPUT_ONLY` indicates that the field is provided in requests and
that the corresponding field will not be included in output.

Additionally, a field **should** only be described as input only if it is a
field in a resource message or a field of a message included within a resource
message. Notably, fields in request messages (a message which only ever acts as
an argument to an RPC, with a name usually ending in `Request`) **should not**
be described as input only because this is already implied.

Potential use cases for input only fields (this is not an exhaustive list) are:

- The `ttl` field as described in AIP-214.

**Warning:** Input only fields are rare and should be considered carefully
before use.

### Immutable

The use of `IMMUTABLE` indicates that a field on a resource cannot be changed
after it's creation. This can apply to either fields that are input or outputs,
required or optional.

When a service receives an immutable field in an update request (or similar),
even if included in the update mask, the service **should** ignore the field if
the value matches, but **should** error with `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if a change is
requested.

Potential use cases for immutable fields (this is not an exhaustive list) are:

- Names or IDs which are set on creation and then used as a primary key.

**Note:** Fields which are "conditionally immutable" **must not** be given the
immutable annotation.

### Unordered List

The use of `UNORDERED_LIST` on a repeated field of a resource indicates that
the service does not guarantee the order of the items in the list.

A field **should** be described as an unordered list if the service does not
guarantee that the order of the elements in the list will match the order that
the user sent, including a situation where the service will sort the list on
the user's behalf.

A resource with an unordered list **may** return the list in a stable order, or
**may** return the list in a randomized, unstable order.

## Rationale

### Required set of annotations

A field used in a request message must be either an input or an output.

In the case of an output, the `OUTPUT_ONLY` annotation is sufficient.

In the case of an input, a field is either required or optional, and therefore
should have at least the `REQUIRED` or `OPTIONAL` annotation, respectively.

### Requiring field behavior

By including the field behavior annotation for each field, the overall behavior
that the resource exhibits is more clearly defined. Clearly defined field
behavior improves programmatic clients and user understanding.

Requiring the annotation also forces the API author to explicitly consider the
behavior when initially authoring of the API.

Modifying field behavior after initial authoring results in
backwards-incompatible changes in clients. For example, making an optional field
required, results in backwards-incompatible changes in the method signature of
an RPC or a resource in an [IaC][] client.

## History

In 2023-05 field_behavior was made mandatory. Prior to this change, the
annotation was often omitted. Its values, e.g. REQUIRED, OUTPUT_ONLY, and
IMMUTABLE, are relied upon to produce high quality clients. Further, when the
value is added after the fact or changes, within a major version, it is
backwards-incompatible, which is likely to break clients.

The benefits of requiring field_behavior, at the time that the API is authored,
surpass the costs to clients and API users of not doing so.
