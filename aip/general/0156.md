# Singleton resources

APIs sometimes need to represent a resource where exactly one instance of the
resource always exists within any given parent. A common use case for this is
for a config object.

## Guidance

An API **may** define _singleton resources_. A singleton resource **must**
always exist by virtue of the existence of its parent, with one and exactly one
per parent.

```proto
rpc GetConfig(GetConfigRequest) returns (Config) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    get: "/v1/{name=users/*/config}"
  };
}

rpc UpdateConfig(UpdateConfigRequest) returns (Config) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    patch: "/v1/{config.name=users/*/config}"
    body: "config"
  };
}
```

- Singleton resources **must not** have a user-provided or system-generated ID;
  their [resource name][aip-122] includes the name of their parent followed by
  one static-segment.
  - Example: `users/1234/config`
- Singleton resources **must not** define the [`Create`][aip-133],
  [`List`][aip-132], or [`Delete`][aip-135] standard methods. The singleton is
  implicitly created or deleted when its parent is created or deleted.
- Singleton resource **should** define the [`Get`][aip-131] and
  [`Update`][aip-134] methods, and **may** define custom methods as
  appropriate.
- Singleton resources are always singular.
   - Example: 'users/1234/thing'
