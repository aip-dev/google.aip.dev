# Singleton resources

APIs sometimes need to represent a resource where exactly one instance of the
resource always exists within any given parent. A common use case for this is
for a settings object.

## Guidance

An API **may** define _singleton resources_. A singleton resource **must**
always exist by virtue of the existence of its parent, with one and exactly one
per parent.

```proto
rpc GetSettings(GetSettingsRequest) returns (Settings) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    get: "/v1/{name=users/*/settings}"
  };
}

rpc UpdateSettings(UpdateSettingsRequest) returns (Settings) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    patch: "/v1/{settings.name=users/*/settings}"
    body: "settings"
  };
}
```

- Singleton resources **must not** have a user-provided or system-generated ID;
  their [resource name][aip-122] includes the name of their parent followed by
  one static-segment.
  - Example: `users/1234/settings`
- Singleton resources **must not** define the [`Create`][aip-133],
  [`List`][aip-132], or [`Delete`][aip-135] standard methods. The singleton is
  implicitly created or deleted when its parent is created or deleted.
- Singleton resource **should** define the [`Get`][aip-131] and
  [`Update`][aip-134] methods, and **may** define custom methods as
  appropriate.

[aip-122]: ./0122.md
[aip-131]: ./0131.md
[aip-132]: ./0132.md
[aip-133]: ./0133.md
[aip-134]: ./0134.md
[aip-135]: ./0135.md
