# Common components

As specified in [AIP-215][], APIs must be self-contained except for the use
of "common component" packages which are intended for use by multiple APIs.

There are two kinds of common component packages:

- Organization-specific common components, covering organization-specific
  concepts such as a "viewport" in Maps.
- Global common components which are generic (i.e. not domain-specific),
  such as "timestamp" or "postal address".

Where it is safe to share a single representation across multiple APIs,
common components can make it easier for clients to interact with those APIs.
Concept-specific client code can be written once, and messages can be used from
the response of one API in the request of another without clunky copying, for
example.

This benefit comes with significant restrictions and limitations, however,
and should not be attempted lightly.

Note that even if the *domain* of a component is common, the requirements of
a component may be organization-specific. For example, some organizations may
have particular requirements of how financial values are represented, leading
to multiple finance-oriented organization-specific common components - because
any global common component would either not meet the organization-specific
requirements, or be too complex for general use.

## Guidance

- Organization-wide common component packages **must** end with `.type`, e.g.
  `google.geo.type` or `google.shopping.type`.
- Organizations **must** consult the API design team before creating a new
  organization-wide common component package.
- Organization-wide common component packages **must** be published in [the
  `googleapis` repository](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis).
- Organizations creating and publishing a new organization-wide common component
  package **must** update this AIP to include it in the
  [list below](#existing-organization-specific-common-component-packages).
- Organizations **must not** define generic components in organization-specific
  common component packages, instead preferring global common components.
- Common components **must not** be "moved" (that is, deleted from one common
  component package and added to a different one) from an organization-specific
  common component package to a global common component package or vice versa.
  - A common component **may** be copied from an organization-specific common
    component package to a global common component package (without deleting the
    original component) if it is found to be more widely-applicable than
    originally expected.
- Fields **should not** be added to existing messages.
- Values **should not** be added to existing enums.
- Fields **must not** be removed from existing messages.
- Values **must not** be removed from existing enums.
- While documentation **may** be clarified, it **should not** change the
  meanings of existing values, including the validity of any given message
  or set of messages.
- New proto messages and enums **may** be added to common component packages.
  - API teams  **should** allow sufficient time for propagation to clients
    before using the new messages and enums in their APIs. Fields may take some
    time for any changes to propagate through publication to client libraries
    and other surfaces.
  - API teams **should** consult widely within their organization, and ideally
    with the API design team, before adding a new message or enum, due to the
    limitations listed above.

## Existing global common components

The global common components, which public-facing protos for an API **may** safely
import, are as follows:

- [`google.api.*`](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/api) (but *not* subpackages of `google.api`)
- [`google.longrunning.Operation`](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/longrunning/operations.proto)
- [`google.protobuf.*`](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/tree/master/src/google/protobuf)
- [`google.rpc.*`](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/rpc/)
- [`google.type.*`][type]

Note that some common components may have internal-only fields. APIs **should**
generally only rely on fields which have been
[released into open source](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis).

Google APIs **may** also import [`google.iam.v1.*`][iam], which provides the
IAM messages used throughout Google.

**Note:** Many APIs also import components from other packages for internal-only
use (e.g. to apply visibility labels or provide instructions to internal
infrastructure). This is acceptable provided that the _public_ components do not
contain such references.

### Protobuf types

The `google.protobuf` package is somewhat special in that it is shipped with
protocol buffers itself, rather than with API tooling. (For most API designers,
this should be an implementation detail).

This package includes a small library of types useful for representing common
programming language constructs:

- [`google.protobuf.Duration`][duration]: Durations, with nanosecond-level
  precision. The protobuf runtime provides helper functions to convert to and
  from language-native duration objects where applicable (such as Python's
  [`timedelta`][timedelta]).
- [`google.protobuf.Struct`][struct]: JSON-like structures (a dictionary of
  primitives, lists, and other dictionaries). The protobuf runtime provides
  helper functions in most languages to convert struct objects to and from
  JSON.
- [`google.protobuf.Timestamp`][timestamp]: Timestamps, with nanosecond-level
  precision. The protobuf runtime provides helper functions in most languages
  to convert to and from language-native timestamp objects (such as Python's
  [`datetime`][datetime]).

### API Types

The `google.type` package provides a "standard library" of types useful for
representing common concepts in APIs. While types are added from time to time
and the definitive list is always [the code][type], several types deserve note:

- [`google.type.Color`][color]: RGB or RGBA colors.
- [`google.type.Date`][date]: Calendar dates, with no time or time zone
  component.
- [`google.type.DayOfWeek`][day_of_week]: The day of the week, with no other
  date, time, or time zone component.
- [`google.type.LatLng`][lat_lng]: Geographic coordinates.
- [`google.type.Money`][money]: Currency.
- [`google.type.PostalAddress`][postal_address]: Postal addresses in most
  countries.
- [`google.type.TimeOfDay`][time_of_day]: Wall-clock time, with no date or time
  zone component.

### Adding to common protos

Occasionally, it may be useful to add protos to these packages or to add to the
list of commonly-available protos. In order to do this, [open an issue][] on
the AIP repository in GitHub, noting the guidelines above.

## Existing organization-specific common component packages

The following organization-specific common component packages exist and conform with the above guidance:

- [`google.apps.script.type`](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/tree/master/google/apps/script/type)
  Common component package for Google Apps Script.
- [`google.geo.type`](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/tree/master/google/geo/type)
  Common component package for Google Maps and the Geo organization.
- [`google.actions.type`](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/tree/master/google/actions/type)
  Common component package for Actions on Google APIs.

## Non-conformant common component packages

The following common component packages exist, but do not conform with the above guidance,
and do not form a precedent for further such packages.

- [`google.cloud.common`](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/tree/master/google/cloud/common):
  This does not conform to the requirement for the package name to end in `.type`. (This would otherwise
  be acceptable, and this package should be considered as the Cloud common component package.)
- [`google.logging.type`](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/tree/master/google/logging/type):
  This appears to be API-specific, although it's used from multiple APIs; some aspects should probably
  be global or in a Cloud common component package.
- [`google.cloud.workflows.type`](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/tree/master/google/cloud/workflows/type):
  API-specific types.
- [`google.cloud.oslogin.common`](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/tree/master/google/cloud/oslogin/common):
  API-specific types, and a non-conformant name.
- [`google.identity.accesscontextmanager.type`](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/tree/master/google/identity/accesscontextmanager/type):
  API-specific types.
- [`google.networking.trafficdirector.type`](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/tree/master/google/networking/trafficdirector/type):
  API-specific types.

## Rationale

Common components are effectively unversioned: APIs evolve independently of
each other, both in terms of definition and implementation. A change such as
adding a field is backward-compatible and predictable in specific APIs, and the
API team can ensure that the server implementation is available before the API
definition is published. By contrast, a change in a common component would
effectively be universally available even if most API implementations did not
take it into account.

Adding a new message or enum is backward-compatible, as it does not affect
existing APIs that may import other messages or enums from the same common
component package.

Consultation with the API design team is required for global common components
and suggested for organization-specific common components as the border between
"generic" and "organization-specific" is a gray area; some generic *concepts*
have organization-specific use cases which surface through the components.

## Changelog
