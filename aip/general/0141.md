# Quantities

Many services need to represent a discrete quantity of items (number of bytes,
number of miles, number of nodes, etc.).

## Guidance

Quantities with a clear unit of measurement (such as bytes, miles, and so on)
**must** include the unit of measurement as the suffix. When appropriate, units
**should** use generally accepted abbreviations (for example, `distance_km`
rather than `distance_kilometers`).

```proto
// A representation of a non-stop air route.
message Route {
  // The airport where the route begins.
  string origin = 1;

  // The destination airport.
  string destination = 2;

  // The distance between the origin and destination airports.
  // This value is also used to determine the credited frequent flyer miles.
  int32 distance_miles = 3;
}
```

If the quantity is a number of items (for example, the number of nodes in a
cluster), then the field **should** use the suffix `_count` (**not** the prefix
`num_`):

```proto
// A cluster of individual nodes.
message Cluster {
  // The number of nodes in the cluster.
  int32 node_count = 1;
}
```

**Note:** Fields **must not** use unsigned integer types, because many
programming languages and systems do not support them well.

### Specialized messages

It is sometimes useful to create a message that represents a particular
quantity. This is particularly valuable in two situations:

- Grouping two or more individual quantities together. Example:
  [`google.protobuf.Duration`][duration]
- Representing a common concept where the unit of measurement may itself vary.
  Example: [`google.type.Money`][money]

APIs **may** create messages to represent quantities when appropriate. When
using these messages as fields, APIs **should** use the name of the message as
the suffix for the field name if it makes intuitive sense to do so.

## Changelog

- **2019-09-13**: Added the prohibition on uint and fixed types.
