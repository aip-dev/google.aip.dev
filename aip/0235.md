# Batch Delete

Some APIs need to allow users to delete a set of resources in a single transaction. A batch delete method provides this functionality.

## Guidance

Batch delete methods are specified using the following pattern:

```proto
rpc BatchDeleteBooks(BatchDeleteBooksRequest) returns (google.protobuf.Empty) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    post: "/v1/shelves/-/books:batchDelete"
    body: "*"
  };
}
```

- The RPC's name **must** begin with `BatchDelete`. The remainder of the RPC name
  **should** be the plural form of the resource being deleted.
- The request message **must** match the RPC name, with a `-Request` suffix.
- The response message **should** be `google.protobuf.Empty`.
  - If the resource is [soft deleted](#soft-delete), the response message
    **should** be a response message containing the updated resources.
  - In the event that the request may take a significant amount of time, the
    response message **must** be a `google.longrunning.Operation` which resolves to
    the correct response.
- The HTTP verb **must** be `POST` (not `DELETE`).
- The HTTP URI **must** end with `:batchDelete`.
- The URL path **should** represent the collection for the resource, matching
  the collection used for simple CRUD operations. If the operation spans
  parents, a dash (`-`) **may** be used as a wildcard.
- The body clause in the `google.api.http` annotation **should** be `"*"`.
- The operation **should** be atomic: it **should** fail for all resources or succeed
  for all resources (no partial success).

### Request message

The request for a batch delete method **should** be specified with the following
pattern:

```proto
message BatchDeleteBooksRequest {
  // The resource names of the books to delete.
  // A maximum of 1000 books can be deleted in a batch.
  repeated DeleteBookRequest requests = 1;
}
```

- The request message **must** include one repeated field which accepts the
  request messages specifying the resources to delete, as specified for
  [standard Delete methods][request-message]. The field **should** be named
  `requests`.
- The request message **must not** contain any other required fields, and
  **should not** contain other optional fields except those described in this or
  another AIP.
- The comment above the names field **should** document the maximum number of
  requests allowed.
- Filter-based matching **must not** be supported, because it makes it too easy for
  users to accidentally delete important data.

### Response message (soft-delete only)

In the case where a response message is necessary because the resource is
soft-deleted, the response **should** be specified with the following pattern:

```proto
message BatchDeleteBooksResponse {
  // Books deleted.
  repeated Book books = 1;
}
```

- The response message **must** include one repeated field corresponding to the
  resources that were soft-deleted.
