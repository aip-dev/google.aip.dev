# Batch methods: Delete

Some APIs need to allow users to delete a set of resources in a single
transaction. A batch delete method provides this functionality.

## Guidance

Batch delete methods are specified using the following pattern:

```proto
rpc BatchDeleteBooks(BatchDeleteBooksRequest) returns (google.protobuf.Empty) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    post: "/v1/{parent=publishers/*}/books:batchDelete"
    body: "*"
  };
}
```

- The RPC's name **must** begin with `BatchDelete`. The remainder of the RPC
  name **should** be the plural form of the resource being deleted.
- The request message **must** match the RPC name, with a `-Request` suffix.
- The response message **should** be `google.protobuf.Empty`.
  - If the resource is [soft deleted](#soft-delete), the response message
    **should** be a response message containing the updated resources.
  - In the event that the request may take a significant amount of time, the
    response message **must** be a `google.longrunning.Operation` which
    resolves to the correct response.
- The HTTP verb **must** be `POST` (not `DELETE`).
- The HTTP URI **must** end with `:batchDelete`.
- The URL path **should** represent the collection for the resource, matching
  the collection used for simple CRUD operations. If the operation spans
  parents, a dash (`-`) **may** be accepted as a wildcard.
- The body clause in the `google.api.http` annotation **should** be `"*"`.
- The operation **should** be atomic: it **should** fail for all resources or
  succeed for all resources (no partial success).
  - If the operation covers multiple locations and at least one location is
    down, the operation **must** fail.

### Request message

The request for a batch delete method **should** be specified with the
following pattern:

```proto
message BatchDeleteBooksRequest {
  // The parent resource shared by all books being deleted.
  // Format: publishers/{publisher}
  // If this is set, the parent of all of the books specified in `names`
  // must match this field.
  string parent = 1;

  // The names of the books to delete.
  // A maximum of 1000 books can be deleted in a batch.
  // format: publishers/{publisher}/books/{book}
  repeated string names = 2;
}
```

- A `parent` field **should** be included. If a caller sets this field, and the
  parent collection in the name of any resource being deleted does not match,
  the request **must** fail.
  - This field **should** be required if only 1 parent per request is allowed.
- The request message **must** include a repeated field which accepts the
  resource names specifying the resources to delete. The field **should** be
  named `names`.
- Other fields besides `name` **may** be "hoisted" from the [standard Delete
  request][request-message]. There is no way to allow for these fields to
  accept different values for different resources; if this is needed, use the
  [alternative request message form](#request-message-containing-standard-delete-request-messages).
- The request message **must not** contain any other required fields, and
  **should not** contain other optional fields except those described in this
  or another AIP.
- The comment above the `names` field **should** document the maximum number of
  requests allowed.
- Filter-based matching **must not** be supported.

### Request message containing standard delete request messages

If the [standard Delete request message][request-message] contains a field
besides the resource name that needs to be different between different
resources being requested, the batch message **may** alternatively hold a
`repeated` field of the [standard Delete request message][request-message].
This is generally discouraged unless your use case really requires it.

The request for a batch delete method **should** be specified with the
following pattern:

```proto
message BatchDeleteBooksRequest {
  // The parent resource shared by all books being deleted.
  // Format: publishers/{publisher}
  // If this is set, the parent of all of the books specified in the
  // DeleteBookRequest messages must match this field.
  string parent = 1;

  // The requests specifying the books to delete.
  // A maximum of 1000 books can be deleted in a batch.
  repeated DeleteBookRequest requests = 2;
}
```

- A `parent` field **should** be included. If a caller sets this field, and the
  parent collection in the name of any resource being deleted does not match,
  the request **must** fail.
  - This field **should** be required if only 1 parent per request is allowed.
- The request message **must** include a repeated field which accepts the
  request messages specifying the resources to delete, as specified for
  [standard Delete methods][request-message]. The field **should** be named
  `requests`.
- Other fields **may** be "hoisted" from the [standard Delete
  request][request-message], which means that the field can be set at either
  the batch level or child request level. Similar to `parent`, if both the
  batch level and child request level are set for the same field, the values
  **must** match.
  - Fields which must be unique cannot be hoisted (e.g. `etag`).
- The request message **must not** contain any other required fields, and
  **should not** contain other optional fields except those described in this
  or another AIP.
- The comment above the `requests` field **should** document the maximum number
  of requests allowed.
- Filter-based matching **must not** be supported unless it is infeasible to
  support critical use cases without it, because it makes it too easy for users
  to accidentally delete important data. If it is unavoidable, see [AIP-165][].

### Response message (soft-delete only)

In the case where a response message is necessary because the resource is
soft-deleted, the response **should** be specified with the following pattern:

```proto
message BatchDeleteBooksResponse {
  // Books deleted.
  repeated Book books = 1;
}
```

- The response message **must** include one repeated field corresponding to the
  resources that were soft-deleted.

## Changelog

- **2020-03-27**: Added reference to AIP-165 for criteria-based deletion.
- **2019-10-11**: Changed the primary recommendation to specify a repeated
  string instead of a repeated standard Delete message. Moved the original
  recommendation into its own section.
- **2019-09-11**: Fixed the wording about which child field the `parent` field
  should match.
- **2019-08-01**: Changed the examples from "shelves" to "publishers", to
  present a better example of resource ownership.
