# Long-running operations

Occasionally, an API may need to expose a method that takes a significant
amount of time to complete. In these situations, it is often a poor user
experience to simply block while the task runs; rather, it is better to return
some kind of promise to the user and allow the user to check back in later.

The long-running operations pattern is roughly analogous to a [Python
`Future`][], or a [Node.js `Promise`][]. Essentially, the user is given a token
that can be used to track progress and retrieve the result.

## Guidance

Individual API methods that might take a significant amount of time to complete
**should** return a [`google.longrunning.Operation`][lro] object instead of the
ultimate response message.

```proto
// Write a book.
rpc WriteBook(WriteBookRequest) returns (google.longrunning.Operation) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    post: "/v1/{parent=shelves/*}/books}:write"
    body: "*"
  };
  option (google.longrunning.operation_info) = {
    response_type: "WriteBookResponse"
    metadata_type: "WriteBookMetadata"
  };
}
```

- The response type **must** be `google.longrunning.Operation`. The `Operation`
  proto definition **must not** be copied into individual APIs.
- The method **must** include a `google.longrunning.operation_info` annotation
  defining the response and metadata types.
  - The response and metadata types **must** be defined in the file where the
    RPC appears, or a file imported by that file.
  - The response type **should not** be `google.protobuf.Empty` (except for
    [`Delete`][aip-135] methods), unless it is certain that response data will
    _never_ be needed. If response data might be added in the future, define an
    empty message for the RPC response and use that.
  - The metadata type **should not** be `google.protobuf.Empty`, unless it is
    certain that metadata will _never_ be needed. If metadata might be added in
    the future, define an empty message for the RPC metadata and use that.
- APIs with messages that return `Operation` **must** implement the
  [`Operations`][lro] service. Individual APIs **must not** define their own
  interfaces for long-running operations to avoid inconsistency.

**Note:** User expectations can vary on what is considered "a significant
amount of time" depending on what work is being done. A good rule of thumb is
10 seconds.

### Standard methods

APIs **may** return an `Operation` from the [`Create`][aip-133],
[`Update`][aip-134], or [`Delete`][aip-135] standard methods if appropriate. In
this case, the response type in the `operation_info` annotation **must** be the
standard and expected response type for that standard method.

When creating or deleting a resource with a long-running operation, the
resource **should** be included in [`List`][aip-132] and [`Get`][aip-131]
calls; however, the resource **should** indicate that it is not usable,
generally with a [state enum][aip-216].

### Expiration

APIs **may** allow their operation resources to expire after sufficient time
has elapsed after the operation completed.

**Note:** A good rule of thumb for operation expiry is 30 days.
