# List command arguments

Some list requests take argument(s) for the parent collection in which to list
resources. For example, suppose an API has book resources belonging to shelf
resources, and consider a request to list books in a shelf:

```proto
message ListBooksRequest {
  // Required. The shelf containing the books to list, for example,
  // "projects/project1/shelves/shelf1".
  string parent = 1;

  // The maximum number of items to return.
  int32 page_size = 2;

  // The next_page_token value returned from a previous List request, if any.
  string page_token = 3;
}
```

For the corresponding gcloud list command, we have the choice between
`gcloud shelves books list SHELF` (positional) and
`gcloud shelves books list --shelf=SHELF` (flag).

## Guidance

All list command arguments should be flags, not positionals. In gcloud's
resource model, command groups generally correspond to resources, and the
positional arguments for commands in a group are reserved for those resources.
In the case of a list command that takes an argument, the argument will refer
to the parent resource and not the command group's resource; therefore, it
should be a flag instead of a positional.

In the example above, the list command takes an argument for a shelf. Commands
in the `books` command group should reserve positional arguments for book
resources. Thus, the shelf argument for the list command should be a flag:

```
gcloud shelves books list --shelf=SHELF
```
