# Project identifiers

Historically, Google had two kinds of projects: API projects and App Engine
projects. API projects used project numbers (e.g. `12345`) as identifiers, and
App Engine projects used project IDs (e.g. `happy-armadillo-789`) as
identifiers. Later, Google converged API projects and App Engine projects, so
now each project has _both_ unique and immutable identifiers.

The two types of identifiers are used differently in different contexts, and
create a lot of complexity for application development. One critical issue is
that applications cannot reliably join data from different services, because
different services use different project identifiers.

## Guidance

**TL;DR:** The project number is the canonical identifier, and the project ID
is an [alias][], and behaves as such. Additionally, third-party services are
unable to _accept_ project IDs.

The rationale for this is:

- Each resource should always have one canonical identifier.
- Because Google's privacy policy restricts the use of project IDs, both
  internally and with partners, only the project number can be the canonical
  identifier.
- Translating from an [alias][] to a canonical identifier should be consistent
  everywhere, including referring to projects.
- Returning resources with project numbers increases the chances that these are
  what users store, which may be important if using third-party services.

### Google APIs

Externally-facing Google APIs **should** accept both project IDs and project
numbers for incoming API requests.

However, the project number is the canonical identifier, and therefore APIs
**must** use project numbers in responses, regardless of whether they were sent
a project ID or a project number.

There are two exceptions to this rule:

- Error responses **must** return the originally-provided value without
  modification. Error responses **must not** perform any translation between
  project IDs and project numbers.
- If a service receives a resource name for a resource that the service does
  not own, it **should not** perform any translation between project IDs and
  project numbers for those resource names.

### Internal Google services

Internal Google services **must** use project numbers for internal data storage
and for output. Project identifiers are widely used as storage keys, which
often appear in logs and metrics. Project IDs are user-settable and thus
considered PII and user data, but project numbers are not.

Therefore, when an internal service calls an external Google APIs, it
**should** use project numbers for making API requests.

### Third-party services

[Third-party services](https://cloud.google.com/marketplace) that are
integrated with Google Cloud Platform **must** only store or provide project
numbers. Google's privacy policy prohibits sharing project IDs with third-party
services, or providing a service for third-party services to translate between
project IDs and project numbers at runtime.

### Project identifier format

APIs **must** use project resource names as defined by the [Resource Manager
API][] to refer to projects, such as `projects/123456`. This allows the same
API to work with other resources similar to projects, such as organizations and
folders.
