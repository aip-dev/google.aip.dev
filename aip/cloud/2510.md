# Project identifiers

Historically, Google had two kinds of projects: API projects and App Engine
projects. API projects used project numbers (e.g. `12345`) as identifiers, and
App Engine projects used project IDs (e.g. `happy-armadillo-789`) as
identifiers. Later, Google converged API projects and App Engine projects, so
now each project has _both_ unique and immutable identifiers.

The two types of identifiers are used differently in different contexts, and
create a lot of complexity for application development. One critical issue is
that applications cannot reliably join data from different services, because
different services use different project identifiers.

## Guidance

**TL;DR:** The project number is the canonical identifier, and the project ID
is an [alias][]; however, unlike normal aliases, it **should** be returned if it
is what the user sent. Additionally, third-party services are unable to
_accept_ project IDs.

The rationale for this is:

- Each resource should always have one canonical identifier.
- Because Google's privacy policy restricts the use of project IDs, both
  internally and with partners, only the project number can be the canonical
  identifier.
- However, even though the project number is the canonical identifier, a policy
  of returning it even if the user sent a project ID has proven to be
  unfriendly to both humans and declarative tools.

### Google APIs

Externally-facing Google APIs **should** accept both project IDs and project
numbers for incoming API requests.

However, even though the project number is the canonical identifier as
described in AIP-122, services **should** return whichever ID the user sent.
The reason for this is because automatic translation between user-friendly
project IDs and user-unfriendly project numbers has proven to cause real-world
difficulty for users, and also for declarative tools (see AIP-128 for more on
declarative-friendliness).

Two additional points:

- Error responses **must** return the originally-provided value without
  modification. Error responses **must not** perform any translation between
  project IDs and project numbers.
- If a service receives a resource name for a resource that the service does
  not own, it **should not** perform any translation between project IDs and
  project numbers for those resource names.

### Internal Google services

Internal Google services **must** use project numbers for internal data storage
and for output. Project identifiers are widely used as storage keys, which
often appear in logs and metrics. Project IDs are user-settable and thus
considered PII and user data, but project numbers are not.

Therefore, when an internal service calls an external Google APIs, it
**should** use project numbers for making API requests.

### Resource References

Project identifiers also appear in [resource names][]. These resource
names are used both to identify the resource itself and can refer to
other resources ([example][]).

Regardless, when project identifiers are provided, the response should
include the identifier as it occurred in the request: if the project ID
was provided it should be returned, and if the project number was
provided, that is what should be in the response.


For example, consider a `Book` resource,

```proto
message Book {
  option (google.api.resource) = {
    type: "pubsub.googleapis.com/Book"
    pattern: "projects/{project}/shelves/{shelf}/books/{book}"
  };

  // The resource name of the Book.
  string name = 1;

  // The resource name of the Shelf to which this book belongs.
  string shelf = 2;


  // Other fields...
}
```

and a `GetBookRequest`,

```proto
message GetBookRequest {
  // The name of the Book to retrieve.
  // Format: projects/{project}/shelves/{shelve}/books/{book}
  string name = 1 [
    (google.api.field_behavior) = REQUIRED,
    (google.api.resource_reference) = {
      type: "library.googleapis.com/Book"
    }];
}

```

if the value of `name` on such a request is,

```
projects/my-project/shelves/6789/books/les-miserables
```

then the value of the field, `name`, returned for the `Book`, should
match: the project ID and not the number. But, the value for the field,
`shelf` should use the project number, as the canonical identifier as
follows:

```
book: projects/my-project/shelves/6789/books/les-miserables
shelf: projects/12345/shelves/6789/books/les-miserables
```

In the event of a [list request][AIP-132], and the `parent` field is
provided with a value, `projects/my-project/shelves/12345`, the value of
the `name` field for each returned `Book` should reference the project
by ID and not the number so that there is parity with the request, and
the value of the field, `shelf`, should do the same.

This guidance is to ensure that there is a minimal difference between user
input and output.

### Third-party services

[Third-party services](https://cloud.google.com/marketplace) that are
integrated with Google Cloud Platform **must** only store or provide project
numbers. Google's privacy policy prohibits sharing project IDs with third-party
services, or providing a service for third-party services to translate between
project IDs and project numbers at runtime.

### Project identifier format

Services **must** use project resource names as defined by the [Resource
Manager API][] to refer to projects, such as `projects/123456`. This allows the
same API to work with other resources similar to projects, such as
organizations and folders.
