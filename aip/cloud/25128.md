# Declarative-friendly interfaces

[google.aip.dev/128](https://google.aip.dev/128)

## Guidance

In addition to the guidance in 
[google.aip.dev/128](https://google.aip.dev/128), the following considerations are necessary for declarative-friendly interfaces. 

### Separating client and server-generated intentions

Individual map fields must either contain client data or server-generated data. Mixing both data origins is non-declarative-friendly as it confuses intent. When both exist within a map field, it is usually impossible to tell the difference between user intentions to remove the entry or to leave management of the entry to the server. A suggested alternative is to separate client data and server-generated data into different fields, where the server-generated map can be specified as output-only.

```proto
// The map field contains client data only.
map<string, string> client_data_map = 1;

// The map field contains server-generated data only.
map<string, string> server_generated_map = 2 [
  (google.api.field_behavior) = OUTPUT_ONLY
];
```
