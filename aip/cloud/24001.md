# Empty Objects

Fields of type Message **must not** be empty. Empty messages do not have uniform

## Alternatives

The presence of empty Messages are sometimes used to indicate that a flag is enabled. Alternatives to empty Messages could include a single boolean field within the Message to signify enablement or an Enum rather than an empty Message.

### Add Field to Message
For example:
```proto
message EnableMyFeature {
}
```
Could be modeled instead as:

```proto
message MyFeature {
  bool enabled = 1;
}
```

### Move Option to Top-Level Enum

For a situation where the presence of an empty Message indicates a certain option is being chosen, an alternative is to choose the option via an enum rather than the presence of a particular object.

For example:
```proto
oneof access_model {
  AccessModelFree free = 1
  AccessModelQuota quota = 2
}

message AccessModelFree {
}

message AccessModelQuota {
  int32 requests_per_day = 1;
}
```

Could be modeled instead as:
```proto
enum AccessModel {
  UNSPECIFIED = 0;
  FREE = 1;
  QUOTA = 1;
}

message AccessModelQuota {
  int32 requests_per_day = 1;
}
```
