# Generic Fields

Guidelines related to generic fields in [AIP-146](../0146.md) **should** be applied
with the following exceptions.

## Maps

Fields of type `map` **must not** be composed of type Message. `map<string, string>`
is permissible, but `map<string, google.protobuf.Struct>` is not allowed.

Alternatively consider defining a separate message type rather than a map of messages or
prefer lists with `UNORDERED_LIST` behavior [AIP-203](../0203.md#unordered-list) where
the key of the map is moved to a field in the Message.

## Changelog

- **TBD**: Created
