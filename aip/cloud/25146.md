# Generic Fields

Guidelines related to generic fields in [AIP-146](../0146.md) **should** be applied
with the following exceptions.

## Maps

The value type of a map **must not** be of type Message

Alternatively consider defining a separate message type rather than a map of messages or
prefer [unordered lists](../0203.md#unordered-list) where the key of the map is moved to a
field in the Message.

## Changelog

- **TBD**: Created
