# Generic Fields

Guidelines related to generic fields in [AIP-146](../0146.md) **should** be applied
with the following exceptions.

## Maps

The value type of a map **must not** be of type Message

The rationale is:
- Cloud APIs are generally used through JSON. In JSON keys are generally field names
rather than arbitrary strings or references to other resources. Many tools that interact
with the JSON API will not be able to handle dynamic keys with static Message values.

### Alternative

Consider using a separate resource rather than a map of objects.

**or**

Prefer lists with `UNORDERED_LIST` behavior where the key of the map is moved to a
field in the Message.

## Changelog

- **TBD**: Created
