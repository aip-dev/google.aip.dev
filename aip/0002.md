# AIP Identifiers

The AIP system provides a mechanism to index and have a single source of truth
for API Improvement Proposals, as well as iterate on them collaboratively and
transparently.

Multiple companies and teams have adopted the AIP system, with the mutual goal
that the identifiers for common concepts should be shared between each
company's AIP program to provide comparability.

## Assigning AIP Numbers

The AIP editors (see [AIP A-1](./0001.md)) are responsible for assigning a
unique identifier to each AIP when it is accepted as a draft for review. For
AIPs expected to be common between companies, one letter and one number are
assigned, and shared across the system. AIPs specific to a single company are
given a three-letter prefix instead of a one-letter prefix.

Importantly, _all_ AIPs have identifiers, not just approved ones. The
[AIP Index](/) clearly delineates which AIPs are approved and binding and which
are under discussion.

## AIP Blocks

Common AIPs are organized into the following over-arching categories:

- **A.** Meta-AIPs (AIPs about AIPs)
- **B.** Resource design
- **C.** Standard methods
- **D.** Custom methods
- **E.** Fields
- **F.** Design Patterns
- **G.** Compatibility
- **H.** File Structure
- **I.** Annotations
- **J.** Process

### Google Product Areas

Specific Google product areas also have prefixes assigned to them. These
prefixes are only guaranteed to be unique within Google (other companies may
use the same prefixes in their AIP systems).

- **AOG:** Actions on Google
- **GCP:** Google Cloud
- **GEO:** Geo
- **GST:** GSuite

To request a block for a specific team that is publishing API guidance or
documentation germane to that specific team, reach out to api-editors@.
