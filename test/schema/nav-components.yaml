  matter_group:
    description: |
      A navigational menu component that allows for the dynamic creation of
      navigation links based on similarities in front matter across multiple
      pages.
    type: object
    required:
      - type
      - id
      - front_matter
    properties:
      type:
        description: |
          The discriminator between menu element types. Must be `matter_group`
          for a matter_group.
        type: string
        enum:
          - matter_group
      front_matter:
        description: |
          The root front matter object within which the properties referrenced
          by this menu element exist.
        type: string
      id:
        description: |
          The property within the front matter to create unique links for. A
          navigation element will be created in the navigation menu for each
          unique value found in this property under the defined front matter.
          Nil is also considered a unique value, which can be used to enable
          default functionality.
        type: string
      order_by:
        description: |
          The propety under the given front matter to be used to order the
          navigation elements within this navigation menu. If this value is not
          provided the values will not be sorted.
        type: string
      display_name:
        description: |
          If the default include file is used to render the navigation element,
          this property can be used to provide a name of the property within
          the given front matter to use as the text of the navigation element
          instead of the name of the page the navigation element will link to.
        type: string
      group_by:
        description: |
          This object can be used to dynamically control the content of the nav
          menu with content related to the current page. This can be used to
          only display the links of sibling pages to the current page, instead
          of all pages. When this is populated, the navigation menu will only
          display links that have the same front matter and the same value in
          the provided property. However, it is recognized that not all pages
          will have the same front matter. In which case the `with` array can
          be used to define additional properties and/or front matter that
          might join with the specified `group_by` property.
        type: object
        required:
          - property
        properties:
          property:
            description: |
              The property to to group by. All pages that have this property in
              the root front matter, and the value of the property matches the
              same value of this property on the current page will be listed as
              a navigation element in this group.
            type: string
          with:
            description: |
              Provide an additional property to compare to the
              `matter_group.group_by.property`. If the value of this additional
              property matches the value of the `matter_group.group_by.property`
              for the current page, the page will be listed as a navigation
              element in the matter_group.

                    If the additional property to compare is not in the root
                    front matter, this is the front matter object the additional
                    property is in.

                property:

                    The additional property to compare to the current page's
                    `groupMatter.group_by.property` value.
