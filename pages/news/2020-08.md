# Field patterns, redux

Welcome to the fifth edition of the **AIP newsletter**, which is designed to
keep you up to date about the AIP program, and particular proposals making
their way through the system. (Our apologies for not publishing a newsletter in
July.)

We have one new AIP this month, on sensitive fields. As always, the AIP
newsletter kicks off what is effectively a "public comment" period: the AIP
editors are happy with this proposal, but we want to ensure that you are too.
Assuming feedback is sufficiently positive, we intend to formally approve these
proposals on Friday, August 28, 2020.

## AIPs under review

### AIP-147: Sensitive fields

> Sometimes APIs need to collect sensitive information such as private
> encryption keys meant to be _stored_ by the underlying service but not
> intended to be _read_ after writing due to the sensitive nature of the data.

[Sensitive fields][aip-147] are fields that are stored by a service but, once
set, not retrievable by the user, such as passwords or private keys. These are
not particularly common in APIs, and often it is sufficient to set them as
`INPUT_ONLY` (as described in AIP-203).

However, there is a challenge in situations where the service needs to provide
some kind of indication that a value has been provided, or provide an
obfuscated value that the original user ought to recognize. This AIP provides a
standard for each of those situations.

A special thanks to [Michael Bleigh][] for writing this AIP.

**Summary:** [AIP-147][] provides patterns for indicators around sensitive
fields.

We are aiming to approve AIP-147 on August 28. If you have feedback, please
