# Auth and Field Masks

Welcome to the seventh edition of the **AIP newsletter**, which is designed to
keep you up to date about the AIP program, and particular proposals making
their way through the system.

We have three new AIP this month. As always, the AIP newsletter kicks off what
is effectively a "public comment" period: the AIP editors are happy with this
proposal, but we want to ensure that you are too. Assuming feedback is
sufficiently positive, we intend to formally approve these proposals on Friday,
March 26, 2021.

## AIPs under review

### AIP-149: Unset field values

> In many messages, many fields are optional: the user is not required to
> provide them, or for output fields, the service might not populate the field.

[Unset field values][aip-149] refer to primitive fields where the service makes
a meaningful distinction between an empty value (such as `0` or `false`) and
not setting the value at all. While this is generally discouraged if an
alternative design is feasible, there are certainly occasions where this is the
best approach.

**Summary:** [AIP-149][] provides guidance around use of the `optional` keyword
for primitives.

We are aiming to approve AIP-149 on March 26. If you have feedback, please
[leave a comment](https://github.com/aip-dev/google.aip.dev/pull/711).

### AIP-161: Field masks

> Often, when updating resources, it is desirable to specify exactly which
> fields are being updated, so that the service can ignore the rest, even if
> the user sends new values.

[Field masks][aip-161] are the way that users are able to specify exactly which
fields to read or update. They are necessary to ensure that adding fields to
existing messages remains backwards-compatible.

While we have had an internal specification for field masks for some time, this
AIP publicizes the specification.

**Summary:** [AIP-161][] provides a public specification for field masks.

We are aiming to approve AIP-161 on March 26. If you have feedback, please
[leave a comment](https://github.com/aip-dev/google.aip.dev/pull/718).

[aip-161]: ../161

### AIP-211: Authorization checks

> The majority of operations, whether reads or writes, require authorization:
> permission to do the thing the user is asking to do. Additionally, it is
> important to be careful how much information is provided to _unauthorized_
> users, since leaking information can be a security concern.

[Authorization checks][aip-211] discusses when in the logical process of a
request the authorization check ought to occur, and what error to send when an
auth check fails.

In particular, if an authorization check fails, regardless of whether the
resource exists, the service consistently returns `PERMISSION_DENIED` with an
error message that also indicates that the resource might not exist.

**Summary:** [AIP-211][] provides guidance about authorization checks: when to
perform them, and what error to send.

We are aiming to approve AIP-211 on March 26. If you have feedback, please
[leave a comment](https://github.com/aip-dev/google.aip.dev/pull/719).
