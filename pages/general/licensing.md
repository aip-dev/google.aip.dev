# Content licensing

We are pleased to license much of the AIP content under terms that explicitly
encourage people to take, modify, reuse, re-purpose, and remix our work as they
see fit.

You will find the following notice at the bottom of many pages:

> Except as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the
> [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License][ccal-4.0], and code samples are
> licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License][apache-2.0]. For details, see
> [content licensing][licensing].

When you see a page with this notice you are free to use
[nearly everything](#restrictions) on the page in your own creations. For
example, you could quote the text in a book, cut-and-paste sections to your
blog, record it as an audiobook for the visually impaired, or even translate it
into Swahili. Really. That's what open content licenses are all about. We just
ask that you give us [attribution](#attribution) when you reuse our work.

In addition, you are free to use the computer source code that appears in the
content (such as in examples) in the code of your own projects.

## Restrictions

We say "nearly everything" as there are a few simple conditions that apply.

Google's trademarks and other brand features are not included in this license.
Please see our [standard guidelines for third party use of Google brand
features][branding] for information about this usage.

In some cases, a page may include content consisting of images, audio or video
material, or a link to content on a different webpage (such as videos or slide
decks). This content is not covered by the license, unless specifically noted.

## Attribution

Proper attribution is required when you reuse or create modified versions of
content that appears on a page made available under the terms of the Creative
Commons Attribution license. The complete requirements for attribution can be
found in section 3 of the [Creative Commons legal code][legal-code].

In practice we ask that you provide attribution to Google to the best of the
ability of the medium in which you are producing the work.

There are several typical ways in which this might apply:

### Exact reproductions

If your online work _exactly reproduces_ text or images from this site, in
whole or in part, please include a paragraph at the bottom of your page that
reads:

> Portions of this page are reproduced from work created and [shared by
> Google][licensing] and used according to terms described in the [Creative
> Commons 4.0 Attribution License][ccal-4.0].

Also, please link back to the original source page so that readers can refer to
it for more information.

### Modified versions

If your online work shows modified text or images based on the content from
this site, please include a paragraph at the bottom of your page that reads:

> Portions of this page are modifications based on work created and [shared by
> Google][licensing] and used according to terms described in the [Creative
> Commons 4.0 Attribution License][ccal-4.0].

Again, please link back to the original source page so that readers can refer
to it for more information. This is even more important when the content has
been modified.

### Other media

If you produce non-hypertext works, such as books, audio, or video, we ask that
you make a best effort to include a spoken or written attribution in the spirit
of the messages above.
