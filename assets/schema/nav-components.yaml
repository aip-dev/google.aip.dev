  matterGroup:
    description: |
      A navigational menu component that allows for the dynamic creation of 
      navigation links based on similarities in front matter across multiple 
      pages.
    type: object
    required:
      - type
      - id
      - frontMatter
    properties:
      type:
        description: |
          The discriminator between menu element types. Must be `matterGroup` 
          for a matterGroup.
        type: string
        enum:
          - matterGroup
      frontMatter:
         description: |
           The root front matter object within which the properties referrenced 
           by this menu element exist.
         type: string
      id:
        description: |
          The property within the front matter to create unique links for. A 
          navigation element will be created in the navigation menu for each 
          unique value found in this property under the defined front matter. 
          Nil is also considered a unique value, which can be used to enable 
          default functionality.
        type: string
      orderBy:
        description: |
          The propety under the given front matter to be used to order the 
          navigation elements within this navigation menu. If this value is not 
          provided the values will not be sorted.
        type: string
      displayName:
        description: |
          If the default include file is used to render the navigation element, 
          this property can be used to provide a name of the property within 
          the given front matter to use as the text of the navigation element 
          instead of the name of the page the navigation element will link to.
        type: string
      include:
        description: |
          The name of an `_includes` file to use to render the navigation 
          element. If this is not provided, the navigation menu and the 
          navigation drawer will specify the default includes file to use for 
          the given context. Regex can be viewed and tested on 
          [Regexer](https://regexr.com/4sor0).

      groupBy:
        description: |
          This object can be used to dynamically control the content of the nav 
          menu with content related to the current page. This can be used to 
          only display the links of sibling pages to the current page, instead 
          of all pages. When this is populated, the navigation menu will only 
          display links that have the same front matter and the same value in 
          the provided property. However, it is recognized that not all pages 
          will have the same front matter. In which case the `with` array can 
          be used to define additional properties and/or front matter that 
          might join with the specified `groupBy` property.

              The property to to group by. All pages that have this property in 
              the root front matter, and the value of the property matches the 
              same value of this property on the current page will be listed as 
              a navigation element in this group.

            description: |
              Provide an additional property to compare to the 
              `matterGroup.groupBy.property`. If the value of this additional 
              property matches the value of the `matterGroup.groupBy.property` 
              for the current page, the page will be listed as a navigation 
              element in the matterGroup.
