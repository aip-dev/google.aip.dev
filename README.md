# API Improvement Proposals

## What are AIPs?

AIP stands for **API Improvement Proposal**, which is a design document
providing high-level, concise documentation for API development. They are to
serve as the source of truth for API-related documentation at Google and the
means by which API teams discuss and come to consensus on API guidance.

## Reading AIPs

The easiest way to read AIPs is using GitHub Pages: [aip.dev](https://aip.dev).
If you prefer, you can also read the source files, which are in this repository
in the [`aip/`](https://github.com/googleapis/aip/tree/master/aip) directory.

## Proposing / Contributing

We would be happy to consider proposals. In order to propose a new AIP, start
by [opening an issue](https://github.com/googleapis/aip/issues). If there is
general interest and it comes time to draft an actual proposal, consult our
[contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
